<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Joseph of Egypt</h2><p><p>As Charles Dickens might have said, it was the best of times and the worst of times in Egypt when Joseph, one of&nbsp; the twelve sons of Jacob, was sold into bondage</p> <p>And as he might have said further, it was a time of light&nbsp; and of darkness, of hope and yet of despair.</p> <p>Egypt at that time was a land of confusion, of political upheaval, of scheming and intrigue and conquest. It was a time of prosperity for the rich minority and yet of extreme poverty for the masses. Although there was no caste system&nbsp; such as existed in India, for example, there was a wide, wide gulf between the very poor and the very rich.</p> <p>Egypt has been a land of mystery for centuries. It was so in the time of Joseph. It was afflicted with many uncertainties, too. Its economy was determined by its dependence upon the great Nile River, which was as fickle as the desert&nbsp; winds. If good rains came in the direction of Ethiopia, Egypt had good crops; if not, famine became the companion of countless peasants. If the rains were too heavy, floods resulted. If they were too light, the hot winds from the desert seemed to consume what little growth there was. Rain was almost unknown in the valleys of that 4,000-mile river.</p></p><p></p><h2>Archaeology of the Boat: A New Introductory Study</h2><p>tracking of course and quick shipping</p><p></p><h2>Neon Genesis Evangelion: Campus Apocalypse, Vol. 1</h2><p>Dark Horse is proud to present the second manga series in its Neon Genesis Evangelion line, Neon Genesis Evangelion: Campus Apocalypse! Shinji Ikari&#39;s parents are gone, and he lives with his legal guardian, Ryoji Kaji, while attending the private NERV Academy. But no one ever told Shinji about its secrets... or that he&#39;d find his fellow students Kaworu, Rei, and Asuka out on the streets late at night - fighting with sword, spear, and whip against an enemy that looks very human, but who Kaworu insists are beings called the Angels...</p><p>&#x201c;Only the names remain&#x201d; is an apt sentiment for this latest reworking of animation-studio Gainax&#x2019;s Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise. Ming&#x2019;s adaptation reads like a typical manga horror/fantasy tale, in which innocent Shinji Ikari stumbles across a mystery when he spots his classmates Kaworu, Rei, and Asuka fighting a creature they call an Angel. Before he knows what is happening, Shinji is drafted into their war, armed with a weapon (an &#x201c;eva&#x201d;) he doesn&#x2019;t know how to use and facing beings who steal the bodies of dead humans. The story will wash over non-Evangelion fans pleasantly, but probably won&#x2019;t leave anything memorable behind. The characters stick true to type (the grumpy pretty girl, the clueless hero, etc.), the battles are over the top, and the explanations are convoluted. Ming&#x2019;s art is clear and attractive, with characters that are distinct from one another, though it too refuses to break much new ground. Evangelion fans, however, are likely to snap this one up quickly and should enjoy seeing their old friends in new situations.

The genius is John Rothstein, a Salinger-like icon who created a famous character, Jimmy Gold, but who hasn&#39;t published a book for decades. Morris Bellamy is livid, not just because Rothstein has stopped providing books, but because the nonconformist Jimmy Gold has sold out for a career in advertising. Morris kills Rothstein and empties his safe of cash, yes, but the real treasure is a trove of notebooks containing at least one more Gold novel. Morris hides the money and the notebooks, and then he is locked away for another crime. Decades later, a boy named Pete Saubers finds the treasure, and now it is Pete and his family that Bill Hodges, Holly Gibney, and Jerome Robinson must rescue from the ever-more deranged and vengeful Morris when he&#39;s released from prison after thirty-five years. Not since Misery has King played with the notion of a reader whose obsession with a writer gets dangerous. Finders Keepers is spectacular, heart-pounding suspense, but it is also King writing about how literature shapes a life - for good, for bad, forever.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of June 2015:</strong> For those of you who spent part of last summer being thrilled by Stephen King&#x2019;s <em>Mr. Mercedes</em>, this worthy sequel arrives just in time for summer 2015. Of course you can read <em>Finders Keepers</em> on its own if you&#x2019;re so-inclined&#x2014;King takes time to introduce new characters and new crimes in the first half of the book before carting out some familiar faces from the past. The story begins with a murder (of an author) and a robbery (of the author&#x2019;s notebooks, including at least one unpublished manuscript). The crimes will linger in your mind, but what might linger most is when King explores his obsessions with, well, obsessions: obsession with reading, obsession with writers, even the need to get revenge. The book is well-plotted, but there remains an organic feel to this series, like the characters are writing themselves to some extent. As a character in <em>Finders Keepers</em> puts it, &#x201c;a good novelist does not create events, he watches them happen then writes down what he sees. A good novelist realizes he is a secretary, not God.&#x201d; Amen. That's why we love you, Stephen King.<em>--Chris Schluep</em></p>Stephen King is the bestselling author of more than fifty books.

Why, in a century of film-making, have so few versions of the story of Alexander the Great - or that of Troy's fall - made it to the big screen? In the aftermath of "Gladiator" (2000), with Hollywood studios rushing to revisit the ancient world with "Troy" and "Alexander" (both 2004), this question takes on renewed significance. Nisbet unpacks the ideas that continue to make Greece hot property - often too hot for Hollywood to handle. His lively explorations, which assume no prior expertise in classical or film studies, will appeal to all with an interest in 'reception': the present day's re-use and re-invention of the past.<br></p><p><br><strong>Gideon Nisbet</strong> is a Lecturer in Classics at the Institute of Archaeology and Antiquity, University of Birmingham. He is the author of Greek Epigram in the Roman Empire: Martial's Forgotten Rivals (Oxford, 2003). He is also an ardent film-goer and observer of the Hollywood scene.<br><br>"Nisbet has succeeded quite admirably with a thoughtful and insightful study of the problems that Greece presents as both a concrete and an abstract image in film and popular thought. This study is sustained by a nuanced understanding in a clear and lucid way with which even the most conservative of readers would feel comfortable. Nisbet's volume is a relatively short and succinctly written exploration. Jargon is avoided when at all possible, but he does provide an extremely helpful glossary of technical terms. One of the great strengths of his work is the effortless command he has of both the classical and modern material, whether he is discussing Socrates or Scorsese. Nisbet's volume is a thoughtful and thought-provoking work on the issues of reception that I foresee becoming a standard text for both students and scholars of classics and film."--<em>Intertexts</em><p></p><br>"... in his entertaining book, the latest in the Bristol Phoenix press 'Greece and Rome Live' series, Gideon Nisbet draws on a range of popular media, including film, TV and comics to explore and expose the preconceptions that have for so long dictated the mise-en-scï¿½ne of our imaginations."--<em>The</em> <em>Anglo-Hellenic Review</em><p></p><br>"Gideon Nesbit injects his own distinctive style and an infectious sense of enthusiasm into his Ancient Greece in Film and Popular Culture. 'As a result one is forced to consider more interesting and provocative questions: not 'Why is Troy a bad film?', but rather 'Why is Greece such a hard concept for the modern world - particularly Hollywood - to think with?"--<em>Greece and Rome</em><p></p><br>"... the time is ripe for turning scholarly (and student) attention to what Greece means in modern popular culture (and why). Gideon Nisbet's book, part of Bristol Phoenix Press's Greece and Rome Live series, serves as a brief but punchy account of the topic, and will be of considerable value to a wide audience. ... this book should be of as much interest to those working in reception study, and classics and ancient history more generally, as it is to students and teachers at whom it is notionally aimed."--<em>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</em><p></p><br>"It is well suited to sparking discussion among undergraduates as well as introducing new perspectives to scholars. Course logistics permitting, I think it would be especially useful in combination with other recent studies as a stimulating introduction to the current scholarly conversation on Classics, media, and popular culture."--<em>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Mine Is the Night: A Novel (Christian Large Print Originals)</h2><p>SHE LOST EVERYTHING SHE LOVED.<br><br>HE HAD EVERYTHING SHE NEEDED.<br><br>BUT COULD SHE FIND THE COURAGE TO TRUST HIM?<br>Stepping from a battered coach on a rainy April eve, newly widowed Elisabeth Kerr must begin again, without husband or title, property or fortune. She is unafraid of work and gifted with a needle, but how will she stitch together the tattered remnants of her life? And who will mend her heart, torn asunder by betrayal and deception?<br><br> Elisabeth has not come to Selkirk alone. Her mother-in-law, Marjory Kerr, is a woman undone, having buried her husband, her sons, and any promise of grandchildren. Dependent upon a distant cousin with meager resources, Marjory dreads the future almost as much as she regrets the past. Yet joy still comes knocking, and hope is often found in unexpected places.<br><br> Then a worthy hero steps forward, rekindling a spark of hope. Will he risk his reputation to defend two women labeled as traitors to the Crown? Or will a wealthy beauty, untainted by scandal, capture his affections?<br><br> The heartrending journey of the Kerr women comes to a glorious finish in Mine Is the Night, a sparkling gem of redemption and restoration set in eighteenth-century Scotland. <br><br></p><p><b>Liz Curtis Higgs</b> is the author of twenty-eight books with three million copies in print, including her armchair travel guide to Scotland, <i>My Heart&#x2019;s in the Lowlands, </i>and her best-selling Scottish historical novels, <i>Thorn in My Heart,</i> <i>Fair Is the Rose</i>, Christy Award&#x2013;winner<i> Whence Came a Prince, Grace in Thine Eyes</i>, and <i>Here Burns My Candle,</i> the riveting prequel to <i>Mine Is the Night.</i>The distant hoofbeats were growing louder.<br><br>Elisabeth Kerr quickly pushed aside the curtain and leaned out the carriage window. A cool spring rain, borne on a blustery wind, stung her cheeks. She could not see the riders on horseback, hidden by the steep hill behind her. But she could hear them galloping hard, closing the gap. Her mother-in-law seemed unconcerned, her attention drawn to the puddle forming at their feet. A frown creased her brow. &#x201c;Do you mean for us to arrive in Selkirk even more disheveled than we already are?&#x201d; Three long days of being jostled about in a cramped and dirty coach had left Marjory<br>Kerr in a mood as foul as the weather.<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2019;Tis not the rain that concerns me.&#x201d; Elisabeth resumed her seat, feeling a bit unsteady. &#x201c;No ordinary traveling party would ride with such haste.&#x201d;<br><br>Marjory&#x2019;s breath caught. &#x201c;Surely you do not think&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do.&#x201d;<br><br>Had they not heard the rumors at every inn and coaching halt? King George&#x2019;s men were scouring the countryside for anyone who&#x2019;d aided bonny Prince Charlie in his disastrous bid to reclaim the British throne for the long deposed<br>Stuarts. Each whispered account was worse than the last. Wounded rebel soldiers clubbed to death. Houses burned with entire families inside. Wives and daughters ravished by British dragoons.<br><br>Help us, Lord. Please. Elisabeth slipped her arm round her mother-in-law&#x2019;s shoulders as she heard the riders crest the hill and bear down on them.<br><br>&#x201c;We were almost home,&#x201d; Marjory fretted.<br><br>&#x201c;The Lord will rescue us,&#x201d; Elisabeth said firmly, and then they were overtaken.<br><br>A male voice cut through the rain-soaked air, and the carriage jarred to a halt.<br><br>Mr. Dewar, their round-bellied coachman, dropped from his perch and landed by the window with a grunt. He rocked back on his heels until he found his balance, then yanked open the carriage door without ceremony. &#x201c;Beg yer pardon, leddies. The captain here would have a wird with ye.&#x201d;<br><br>Marjory&#x2019;s temper flared. &#x201c;He cannot expect us to stand in the rain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;On the contrary, madam.&#x201d; A British dragoon dismounted and rolled into view like a loaded cannon. His shoulders were broad, his legs short, his neck invisible. &#x201c;I insist upon it. At once, if you please.&#x201d;<br><br>With a silent prayer for strength, Elisabeth gathered her hoops and maneuvered through the narrow carriage doorway. She was grateful for Mr. Dewar&#x2019;s hand as she stepped down, trying not to drag her skirts through the mud. Despite the evening gloom, her eyes traced the outline of a hillside town not far south. Almost home.<br><br>The captain, whom Elisabeth guessed to be about five-and-forty years, watched in stony silence as Marjory disembarked. His scarlet coat was drenched, his cuffed, black boots were covered with filth, and the soggy brim of his cocked hat bore a noticeable wave.<br><br>He was also shorter than Elisabeth had first imagined. When she lifted her head, making the most of her long neck, she was fully two inches taller than he. Some days she bemoaned her height but not this day.<br><br>By the time Marjory joined her on the roadside, a half-dozen uniformed men had crowded round. Broadswords hung at their sides, yet their scowls were far more menacing.<br><br>&#x201c;Come now,&#x201d; Mr. Dewar said gruffly. &#x201c;Ye&#x2019;ve nae need to frighten my passengers. State yer business, and be done with it. We&#x2019;ve little daylight left and less than a mile to travel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Selkirk is your destination?&#x201d; The captain seemed disappointed. &#x201c;Not many Highland rebels to be found there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2019;Tis a royal burgh,&#x201d; Marjory told him, her irritation showing. &#x201c;Our townsfolk have been loyal to the crown for centuries.&#x201d;<br><br>Elisabeth shot her a guarded look. Have a care, dear Marjory.<br><br>The captain ignored her mother-in-law&#x2019;s comments, all the while studying their plain black gowns, a curious light in his eyes. &#x201c;In mourning, are we? For husbands, I&#x2019;ll wager.&#x201d; He took a brazen step toward Elisabeth, standing entirely too close. &#x201c;Tell me, lass. Did your men give their lives in service to King George? At Falkirk perhaps? Or Culloden?&#x201d;<br><br>She could not risk a lie. Yet she could not speak the truth.<br><br>Please, Lord, give me the right words.<br><br>Elisabeth took a long, slow breath, then spoke from her heart. &#x201c;Our brave men died at Falkirk honoring the King who has no equal.&#x201d;<br><br>He cocked one eyebrow. &#x201c;Did they now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye.&#x201d; She met the captain&#x2019;s gaze without flinching, well aware of which sovereign she had in mind. I am God, and there is none like me. She&#x2019;d not lied. Nor had the dragoon grasped the truth behind her words: by divine right the crown belonged to Prince Charlie.<br><br>&#x201c;No one compares to His Royal Highness, King George,&#x201d; he said expansively.<br><br>&#x201c;Though I am sorry for your loss. No doubt your men died heroes.&#x201d;<br><br>Elisabeth merely nodded, praying he&#x2019;d not ask their names. A list of royalist soldiers killed at Falkirk had circulated round Edinburgh for weeks. The captain might recall that Lord Donald and Andrew Kerr were not named among the British casualties. Instead, her handsome husband and his younger brother were counted among the fallen rebels on that stormy January evening.<br><br>My sweet Donald. However grievous his sins, however much he&#x2019;d wounded her, she&#x2019;d loved him once and mourned him still.<br><br>Her courage bolstered by the thought of Donald in his dark blue uniform, Elisabeth squared her shoulders and ignored the rain sluicing down her neck. &#x201c;My mother-in-law and I are eager to resume our journey. If we are done here&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We are not.&#x201d; Still lingering too near, the captain inclined his head, measuring her. &#x201c;A shame your husband left such a bonny widow. Though if you fancy another soldier in your bed, one of my men will gladly oblige&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sir!&#x201d; Marjory protested. &#x201c;How dare you address a lady in so coarse a manner.&#x201d;<br><br>His dragoons quickly closed ranks. &#x201c;A lady?&#x201d; one of them grumbled. &#x201c;She sounds more like a Highlander to my ear.&#x201d;<br><br>The captain&#x2019;s expression darkened. &#x201c;Aye, so she does.&#x201d; Without warning he grasped the belled cuff of Elisabeth&#x2019;s sleeve and turned back the fabric.<br><br>&#x201c;Where is it, lass?Where is your silk Jacobite rose?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve no need to look.&#x201d; Elisabeth tried to wrest free of him. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t one.&#x201d;<br><br>Ignoring her objections, he roughly examined the other cuff, nearly tearing apart the seam. &#x201c;The white rose of Scotland was Prince Charlie&#x2019;s favorite, was it not? I&#x2019;ve plucked them off many a Highland rebel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I imagine you have.&#x201d; Elisabeth freed her sleeve from his grasp. &#x201c;Are you quite satisfied?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Far from it, lass.&#x201d; The captain eyed the neckline of her gown, his mouth twisting into an ugly sneer. &#x201c;It seems your flower is well hidden. Nevertheless, I mean to have it.&#x201d;</p><h2>Fire Logic (Elemental Logic)</h2><p><br>Earth * Air * Water * Fire<br><br>These elements have sustained the peaceful people of Shaftal for generations, with their subtle powers of healing, truth, joy, and intuition.<br><br>But now, Shaftal is dying.<br><br>The earth witch who ruled Shaftal is dead, leaving no heir.

Much of it is derivative and badly written; some is well written and singular. Among the rare and glorious successes is Laurie J. Marks's <i>Fire Logic</i>, an original, skillfully written, powerfully imagined novel of war and intrigue, a high fantasy that owes little to Tolkien's trilogy, though both are intelligent, adult works that may also be enjoyed by younger readers.<p> In the world of <i>Fire Logic</i>, the rare individuals born with magic talent are known as elementals, because they possess the power of fire, earth, air, or water. The fire elemental Emil is a Paladin, a Shaftali soldier-scholar who is about to embark on his most desired studies when the invading Sainnites capture the capitol and kill the wizard ruler, leaving no heir; now Emil must become a war commander in the remnants of the Shaftali army. Another fire elemental, Zanja na'Tarwein, is the Ashawala'i Speaker, but she cannot convince her own people of the full danger of the Sainnites. Karis, a half-giant blacksmith, has tremendous earth powers that might defeat the Sainnites--if she weren't addicted to a potent, deadly drug that steals her will. Her guardian, Norina the Truthken, is an air elemental able to see through any lie, yet she is blind to dangerous truths about both her half-giant charge and Paladin treachery. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p><br>"Marks is an absolute master of fantasy in this book."<br>--<i>Booklist</i> (starred review)<br><br>Earth * Air * Water * Fire<br><br>These elements have sustained the peaceful people of Shaftal for generations, with their subtle powers of healing, truth, joy, and intuition.<br><br>But now, Shaftal is dying.<br><br>The earth witch who ruled Shaftal is dead, leaving no heir.

She was sitting talking to the Englishwoman.</p> <p>&#x2018;You&#x2019;ll find her a quiet, reasonable child.&#x2019;</p> <p>It made the reasonable child feel grave, important, while remaining unconvinced.</p> <p>She was standing in a smaller room which opened off the important one where callers are received. It was a house of many rooms, whether their purpose was reasonable or not she hadn&#x2019;t had time to find out, but sensed that she might approve of the house, dark and quiet, standing on the edge of this precipice.</p> <p>She looked down through the closed window, through the leaves of dark yet glossy trees growing out of a wall of rock above the shining water of a small, private-seeming bay. More than anything the water consoled, its light that of the Gulf. She half-expected that if the curtain were to lift she would catch sight of the volcano on the island opposite. But the leaves were unmoved. She was reminded of the trees in the Royal Garden. As she ran past the benches with their officers and girls she heard her feet crunch on the gravel, running through the cool towards the muddy smell of ducks.</p> <p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sure she won&#x2019;t give you any trouble,&#x2019; (Mamma was saying in the <i>saloni</i>.)</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh dear no, I can see, Mrs&#x2014;er&#x2014;Sklavos&#x2019; carefully,</p> <p>&#x2018;I can see she is quite the grown-up little lady.&#x2019; Suddenly Mamma burst into tears, through her crying the sound of furniture a rusty stirring and another sort of motion which must have been this Englishwoman&#x2019;s, she had the figure of a dressmaker&#x2019;s dummy.</p> <p>&#x2018;It must be a comfort to know she will be on British soil.&#x2019;</p> <p>Mamma could have been mopping her tears. &#x2018;But we are not British, Mrs Bulpit.

The lips shone with crimson grease rising to a little bow, they matched the nails in the marzipan hands, one of them lying in a black lap, the other dangling from a sofa arm the colour of age and dust. More than anything, more than the crimson trim- mings of her face and fingers, the colour of her hair made Mrs Bulpit noticeable, the little curls with which her head was arranged were of a rich red such as you see in a windowful of new furniture. The curls had a varnished look and though they might have been freshly done they gave no life to Mrs Bulpit&#x2019;s flesh, they only emphasised its dead pallor.</p> <p>Mamma blew her nose. &#x2018;If you have any queries there is my cousin Mrs Lockhart.&#x2019;</p> <p>She had almost eaten off the stuff she had put on her lips for arrival. Nothing to compare with the paint Mrs Bulpit used, Mamma&#x2019;s lips looked blenched and bitten.</p> <p>&#x2018;You may wonder,&#x2019; she said in the foreign-sounding English she had begun using in this house, &#x2018;why my cousin does not take Eirene. Too many of her own. <br>&#x2014;Then too, Alison is one of those who does not care for additional responsibility.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Nobody can say,&#x2019; Mrs Bulpit was saying, &#x2018;that I haven&#x2019;t a highly developed sense of responsibility.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;I also thought Eirene, an only child, might feel oppressed in a large family.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;That is correct. An only child. One myself. And she&#x2019;ll have her playmate. Another little refugee.</p> <p>He ought to be in presently. Why he isn&#x2019;t? One I told you of . . . English boy . . .&#x2019;</p> <p>Perhaps remembering something, Mrs Bulpit withdrew the hand hanging from the sofa arm and plaited it with the one lying in her lap, as though preparing to protect herself against something Mamma might do or say. At the same time what sounded like a wheeze rustled out of the plastic bust of the dressmaker&#x2019;s dummy.</p> <p>&#x2018;Nobody is wholly responsible for what they are.&#x2019; Mamma&#x2019;s voice sounded tired and dull.</p> <p>Mrs Bulpit sat contemplating this remark. She was at a temporary loss.</p> <p>While the child&#x2019;s loss felt permanent she wondered whether to stay in the room or leave it for one of the many others, or the now forbidding precipice outside. Though relieved to have avoided the family of Lockhart cousins, she dreaded her meeting with this boy, probably lurking and listening, the other side of a none too solid wall as she was lurking and listen- ing inside her solitary body. Mamma&#x2019;s eaten lips and adoption of a foreign sounding accent showed her she could expect nothing from that direction. If only Papa. But Papa was dead.</p> <p>&#x2018;You&#x2019;ll have to admit when you meet him he&#x2019;s a handsome little lad, Mrs&#x2014;Sklavos. Blue eyes. And the loveliest hair&#x2014;pale gold . . .&#x2019;</p> <p>Papa&#x2019;s eyes were almost black. They crackled with fire when he talked about what he saw as the future. Now the future was a shapeless dread in what was a stockstill present.</p> <p>She ended up leaving the <i>saloni</i>.

Real estate managers today are more than property overseers who must manage the day-to-day operations of their clients&#39; properties-they are often asset managers. This book provides insight into the real estate management company and manager&#39;s role in the financial analysis and asset management of a property. It also provides an inside look into the details of how to budget, forecast, and analyze cash flow. Even if some real estate managers are not actively performing the financial analysis and management of a portfolio of investment real estate, they must have a basic understanding of the impact that various decisions about a property have on the cash flow and value of a property. Today, owners have high expectations of their real estate management professionals. A strong knowledge of finance is an advantage that can enhance a real estate manager&#39;s relationships with clients and the professionals that turn to them for their expertise. Real estate managers play a key role in preserving and enhancing the earning power of a real estate investment, and ultimately the investment&#39;s value. Experience, knowledge, and skills that are kept up to date are critical to being competitive and respected. &#34;How you perform as a real estate manager-NOI increases, vacancy decreases, and really looking at your budget fundamentals-has a direct impact on the value of your property. I would rather take a mediocre property and a top notch manager (preferably a CPM) than a top notch property and a mediocre manager any day.&#34; -John D.

The phrase haunted him through his life, even as he found the literary acclaim he sought after his 1999 novel, <i>An Underachiever&#x2019;s Diary,</i> had made the smart set take notice.<i>Too Good to Be True</i> is his deeply moving memoir of fathers and sons, crushing debt and infidelity&#x2014;and the first, cautious steps taken toward piecing a life back together.<br><br>&#x201c;It took a long time for me to admit I had failed,&#x201d; Anastas begins. Broke, his promising literary career evaporated, he&#x2019;s hounded by debt collectors as he tries to repair a life ripped apart by the spectacular implosion of his marriage, which ended when his pregnant wife left him for another man. Had it all been too good to be true? Anastas&#x2019;s fierce love for his young son forces him to confront his own childhood, fraught with mental illness and divorce. His father&#x2019;s disdain for money might have been in line with the &#x2019;70s zeitgeist&#x2014;but what does it mean when you&#x2019;re dumping change into a Coinstar machine, trying to scrounge enough to buy your son a meal? Charged with rage and despair, humor and hope, this unforgettable book is about losing one&#x2019;s way and finding it again, and the redemptive power of art.</p></p><p><br> <strong>A Q&amp;A with Ben Anastas</strong> <p><em>Susan Choi is the author of three acclaimed novels, </em>The Foreign Student<em> (winner of an Asian American Literary Award), </em>American Woman<em> (a Pulitzer Prize finalist) and </em>A Person of Interest<em> (finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award). She recently won a 2012 James Beard Foundation Award for her food writing.</em></p> <p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Susan Choi:</strong> What made you want to write this book?</p> <p><strong>Ben Anastas:</strong> I&#x2019;m not sure that I ever really wanted to write <em>Too Good to Be True</em>. The motivation behind the book ran much deeper than that. The word &#x201c;want&#x201d; implies a choice, and when I started writing the book&#x2019;s first pages, having the freedom to choose what to do with my life&#x2014;even calling myself a writer&#x2014;felt like a privilege I had lost.</p> <p>I was 41 and my literary career was flat lining. I hadn&#x2019;t published a book in the U.S. in almost ten years, and the magazines I&#x2019;d been writing for had either disappeared or stopped answering my emails I&#x2019;d lost my marriage in a mind-bending divorce drama. I was scrambling to keep it all together and telling myself that rescue was just around the corner and everything would be fine&#x2014;but when the book starts, in the fall of 2010, my financial life was about to hit rock bottom.</p> <p>Nothing I tried was working. So I started over again, from the beginning. I took an empty notebook and a couple of pens and I started going into my son&#x2019;s room when he wasn&#x2019;t there and writing about what was happening, what getting lost in too much life really felt like.</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> This book is so startling, and funny, and disturbing, and gut-wrenchingly honest. Were there people in your life you particularly hoped would or wouldn&#x2019;t read it? </p> <p><strong>BA:</strong> If you&#x2019;re startled as a reader or moved to laughter and/or tears, then I must have done my job, right?</p> <p>You never know what episodes from your private life will end up making it into a novel. I knew my parents would have to read <em>Too Good to Be True</em> eventually, but I did put it off until I felt confident about what I was doing. The title comes from some very bad therapy that my brother, my sister and me all had during the summer of 1972&#x2014;a lifetime ago&#x2014;while our mother was being treated for depression. Their marriage was ending, it was a low-point in their lives, and we were bystanders in a drama that we didn&#x2019;t understand. I feel very protective of my parents so I was worried from the start about how they would react to those sections of the book. I just had to gulp and hand the manuscript over.</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> How did fatherhood affect the writing of this book, if at all? How has it affected your writing in general?</p> <p><strong>BA:</strong> My son, who&#x2019;s five now and too young to read the book&#x2014;another sigh of relief&#x2014;is the driving force behind <em>Too Good to Be True</em>, even when he&#x2019;s not present, and the final chapter is a kind of letter to him explaining what I&#x2019;ve been up to. So, in a very real sense, the book wouldn&#x2019;t exist without him. You really do need a reason to go on when you find yourself broke at forty-one and hiding collection notices in your underwear drawer, and he was a very big reason why I managed to go on.</p> <p>When a child&#x2019;s room is empty, you really know it. There&#x2019;s no clamor inside, no calls for &#x201c;Daddy,&#x201d; no astonishing new mess to clean up. As a part-time father, it&#x2019;s a quiet that I&#x2019;ve had to learn to get used to. There was something very satisfying about the ritual of going into his room and trying to find my way on paper. His bed was made and empty, his stuffed animals were heaped at my side, his clothes were stacked on the dresser and there I was with my notebook, trying to untangle the mystery of my origins so he wouldn&#x2019;t have to.</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> What comes next?</p> <p><strong>BA:</strong> There&#x2019;s a novel brewing. Definitely fiction.

Yet the twentieth century might have turned out differently had greater influence over this technology been exercised by Great Britain, whose scientists were at the forefront of research into nuclear weapons at the beginning of World War II.<br><br>As award-winning biographer and science writer Graham Farmelo describes in <i>Churchill's Bomb</i>, the British set out to investigate the possibility of building nuclear weapons before their American colleagues. But when scientists in Britain first discovered a way to build an atomic bomb, Prime Minister Winston Churchill did not make the most of his country's lead and was slow to realize the Bomb's strategic implications. This was odd&#x2014;he prided himself on recognizing the military potential of new science and, in the 1920s and 1930s, had repeatedly pointed out that nuclear weapons would likely be developed soon. In developing the Bomb, however, he marginalized some of his country's most brilliant scientists, choosing to rely mainly on the counsel of his friend Frederick Lindemann, an Oxford physicist with often wayward judgment. Churchill also failed to capitalize on Franklin Roosevelt's generous offer to work jointly on the Bomb, and ultimately ceded Britain's initiative to the Americans, whose successful development and deployment of the Bomb placed the United States in a position of supreme power at the dawn of the nuclear age. After the war, President Truman and his administration refused to acknowledge a secret cooperation agreement forged by Churchill and Roosevelt and froze Britain out of nuclear development, leaving Britain to make its own way. Dismayed, Churchill worked to restore the relationship. Churchill came to be terrified by the possibility of thermonuclear war, and emerged as a pioneer of dï¿½tente in the early stages of the Cold War.<br><br>Contrasting Churchill's often inattentive leadership with Franklin Roosevelt's decisiveness, <i>Churchill's Bomb</i> reveals the secret history of the weapon that transformed modern geopolitics.<br><br></p><p><b>Graham Farmelo</b> is a Bye-Fellow at Churchill College, University of Cambridge, and an adjunct professor of physics at Northeastern University.

Superbly written, with a [Frederick] Lindemann-like flair for the translation of scientific data into layman's terms, it is a narrative driven by personalities rather than institutions and studded with memorable cameos of the scientists, politicians and bureaucrats involved.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Roger Highfield, Science Museum executive, <i>Daily Telegraph</i> columnist, and bestselling science writer</b><br> A riveting, powerful, and timely reminder that high politics is anything but rational. Graham Farmelo vividly reveals how Winston Churchill learned about atomic physics in the 1920s, warned about the imminence of nuclear weapons in the 30s, and yet, paradoxically, squandered Britain's lead in the field during the Second World War.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Andrew Brown, author of <i>Keeper of the Nuclear Conscience</i></b><br>"Churchill's curiosity about science is perhaps the least studied aspect of his character.

Graham Farmelo sensitively and eloquently deconstructs the twists and turns of Winston Churchill's involvement with nuclear weapons over nearly half a century, setting this unfamiliar tale in the context of the turbulent times. At its heart are the ambiguities of the World War II relationship between a scientifically innovative but economically weakened Britain and the inexhaustibly energetic USA with unlimited resources.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>Winnipeg Free Press</b></i><br> [A] nuanced and engaging study of nuclear politics....

Farmelo is especially good on the Second World War years, revealing much about the Anglo-American relationship that has been guarded or unclear.... Colourful.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>America in WWII</b></i><br> Although Farmelo devotes a respectable number of words to explaining concepts related to nuclear science, his background material is well-written, and there's just enough to set the scene. He builds the framework of his argument around the intriguing and complex relationships of the players and how could he go wrong when the central player is Winston Churchill?&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>Washington Post</b></i><br> On the eve of World War II, British scientists were well ahead of the United States in the basic research to make a nuclear weapon possible. How the United States wrested that leadership away from Great Britain is the topic of Graham Farmelo's account of a little-known aspect of the war.... [T]his is an interesting story.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>Times Higher Education</b></i><br> Splendid and original.... <i>Churchill's Bomb</i> is at once a tribute to Churchill's foresight in seeing clearly in the inter-war period both the potential and the dangers of a form of energy that few believed would ever be harnessed, and a criticism of him for having allowed leadership in nuclear technology for industrial and military purposes to pass to the US.... In interweaving the political and the scientific, Farmelo succeeds in making the latter beautifully clear even to readers with scant background in the subject. His book also shows that the quarrels between scientists can be just as fierce as those between politicians.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>The Observer</b></i><b> (UK)</b><br> [An] absorbing account of 20th century atomic politics.... Farmelo's account of Churchill's atomic dreams perfectly captures the essence of the man and of the science of the day.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>The Times</b></i><b> (UK)</b><br> <i>Churchill's Bomb</i> tells an even more dramatic story [than Farmelo told in <i>The Strangest Man</i>], and tells it brilliantly.... There are many books about the creation of nuclear weapons and even more about Churchill, but Farmelo's is the first that explains the latter's role in the former.... Farmelo ingeniously interweaves the narratives of the nuclear scientists, many of them Jewish refugees from Germany, with that of Churchill in war and peace. As the Americans enter the picture the story becomes fiendishly complicated, but the author never loses the thread.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>The London Review of Books</b></i><br> Compelling.... The value of Farmelo's book is in its meticulous attention to the contingencies, accidents, uncertainties, inconsistencies and idiosyncratic personalities in the story of how Britain didn't get the Bomb during the war and how it did get it afterwards. It could all have turned out differently but it didn't.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>The Sunday Times</b></i><br> An excellent book....

It is also a compendium of mini-biographies of all the significant players in this gargantuan story, each deftly and compassionately told, with touches of apt simile, wit and poignancy.... <i>Churchill's Bomb</i> is a powerful and moving contribution to literature about the 20th century and to biographical and historical writing.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>The Economist</b></i><br> <i>[Churchill's Bomb]</i> scores some powerful points."<br><br><i><b>New York Review of Books</b></i><br> This book is the story of a love triangle.

All signs point to the local circus--an underworld of offbeat sex, drugs, blackmail, murder, and in the center of it all, there was a little girl.</p><p>Matthew Hope has been mysteriously shot--by whom? As he lies in a hospital bed in a near-coma, his friends try to discover why his professional involvement with a small circus had murderous results. To do this they must traverse a web of sinister acrobats, kinky animal trainers, and beautiful businesswomen--one of whom is a ruthless killer.Matthew Hope has been shot - taking two bullets outside a bar in Calusa&#39;s seediest neighborhood. With Matthew in a postsurgery semicoma, the men and women who know him best go to the places he went, talk to the people he talked to, and desperately try to find out who wanted Matthew Hope dead. The sexy, tough investigator called Toots Kiley, the world-weary cop named Morris Bloom, and Warren Chambers, a strong black man who gets reminded every day that Florida is still the Deep South, start to get the picture: Matthew Hope had walked into a weird and wild world. Hope had been hired to close a real estate deal for a small, successful circus. He found himself surrounded by trapeze artists, wild animal trainers, seductive dancers, and freaks who shared a society of amazing feats, kinky sex, and dark secrets. Before Hope could do his job he had to find out how a curvacious three-foot-tall woman met a violent death, and what happened to her extensive estate. Instead of an answer, Hope got a riddle. Now in a Calusa hospital, he fights for his life. His friends scramble for clues.

Such was Ferrari's breadth and depth in motorsport that they were able to mix and match components relatively quickly and the new car was revealed at the 1969 Turin Motor Show although it was only ready to race the following year. Mauro Forghieri, under whose direction the 512 was developed, used a semi-monocoque chassis similar to that of the 612 P Can-Am car, and the car was fitted with a 5-litre V12 engine.

As no one has done before, Patterson reveals how the complex interplay between Christian sacrificial symbolism and the deep recesses of post-bellum Southern culture resulted in some of the most shameful, barbaric events in American history.The third essay brings us into the late twentieth century, with an investigation of the various images of Afro-American men portrayed by the media. From the demigod (Michael Jordan) to the demon (Colin Ferguson) to the demigod-turned-demon (O. J. Simpson) and the crossers of racial and gender boundaries (Michael Jackson and Dennis Rodman)&#x2014;all contribute to the cultural complications of our contemporary society.<i>Rituals of Blood</i> advances Patterson's new model of ethnic relations that opens American society to a new and freer dialogue.</p><p>African Americans have triumphed over slavery and continue to fight the good fight against racism and segregation in America, but according to noted Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson, the battles have exacted a heavy price on Afro-American social relations. With pointed, precise, and often painful prose, Patterson outlines several areas of contention in the black community: combustible male-female relations, the destructive media images of African American males, and the horrible legacy of lynching and its parallel of religious sacrifice. His conclusions may be controversial for some, as were those of 1997's <i>The Ordeal of Integration</i>, but Patterson takes on the role of a doctor willing to endure the protests of his patient to lead him to good health. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i><b>Orlando Patterson</b> is the John Cowles Professor of Sociology at Harvard University.</p><h2>Gemini G.E.L.

He published his first novel Casino Royale in 1953 and thus started the astoundingly successful James Bond novels and films. Fleming died in 1964.<p><b>1. SEASCAPE WITH FIGURES</b></p> <p>The five-mile promenade of Royale-les-Eaux, backed by trim lawns emblazoned at intervals with tricolour beds of salvia, alyssum and lobelia, was bright with flags and, on the longest beach in the north of France, the gay bathing tents still marched prettily down to the tide-line in big, money-making battalions. Music, one of those lilting accordion waltzes, blared from the loud-speakers around the Olympic-size piscine and, from time to time, echoing above the music, a man's voice announced over the public address system that Phil-ippe Bertrand, aged seven, was looking for his mother, that Yolande Lefevre was waiting for her friends below the clock at the entrance, or that a Madame Dufours was demanded on the telephone. From the beach, particularly from the neighbourhood of the three play-ground enclosures - 'Joie de Vivre', 'Helio' and 'Azur' - came a twitter of children's cries that waxed and waned with the thrill of their games and, farther out, on the firm sand left by the now distant sea, the shrill whistle of the physical-fitness instructor marshalled his teenagers through the last course of the day.</p> <p>It was one of those beautiful, naive seaside panoramas for which the Brittany and Picardy beaches have provided the setting - and inspired their recorders, Boudin, Tissot, Monet - ever since the birth of plages and bains de mer more than a hundred years ago.</p> <p>To James Bond, sitting in one of the concrete shelters with his face to the setting sun, there was something poignant, ephemeral about it all. It reminded him almost too vividly of childhood - of the velvet feel of the hot powder sand, and the painful grit of wet sand between young toes when the time came for him to put his shoes and socks on, of the precious little pile of sea-shells and interesting wrack on the sill of his bedroom window ('No, we'll have to leave that behind, darling. It'll dirty up your trunk!'), of the small crabs scuttling away from the nervous fingers groping beneath the seaweed in the rock-pools, of the swimming and swimming and swimming through the dancing waves -always in those days it seemed, lit with sunshine - and then the infuriating, inevitable 'time to come out'. It was all there, his own childhood, spread out before him to have another look at. What a long time ago they were, those spade-and-bucket days! How far he had come since the freckles and the Cadbury milk chocolate Flakes and the fizzy lemonade! Impatiently Bond lit a cigarette, pulled his shoulders out of their slouch and slammed the mawkish memories back into their long-closed file. Today he was a grown-up, a man with years of dirty, dangerous memories - a spy. He was not sitting in this concrete hideout to sentimentalise about a pack of scrubby, smelly children on a beach scattered with bottle-tops and lolly-sticks and fringed by a sea thick with sun-oil and putrid with the main drains of Royale. He was here, he had chosen to be here, to spy. To spy on a woman.</p> <p>The sun was getting lower. Already one could smell the September chill that all day had lain hidden beneath the heat. The cohorts of bathers were in quick retreat, striking their little camps and filtering up the steps and across the promenade into the shelter of the town where the lights were going up in the cafes. The announcer at the swimming-pool harried his customers: 'Allo! Allo! Fermeture en dix minutes! A dix-huit heures, fermeture de la piscine!' Silhouetted in the path of the setting sun, the two Bombard rescue-boats with flags bearing a blue cross on a yellow background were speeding northwards for their distant shelter up-river in the Vieux Port. The last of the gay, giraffe-like sand-yachts fled down the distant water-line towards its corral among the sand dunes, and the three agents cyclistes in charge of the car-parks pedalled away through the melting ranks of cars towards the police station in the centre of the town. In a matter of minutes the vast expanse of sand - the tide, still receding, was already a mile out - would be left to the seagulls that would soon be flocking in their hordes to forage for the scraps of food left by the picnickers. Then the orange ball of the sun would hiss down into the sea and the beach would, for a while, be entirely deserted, until, under cover of darkness, the prowling lovers would come to writhe briefly, grittily in the dark corners between the bathing-huts and the sea-wall.</p> <p>On the beaten stretch of sand below where James Bond was sitting, two golden girls in exciting bikinis packed up the game of Jokari which they had been so provocatively playing, and raced each other up the steps towards Bond's shelter. They flaunted their bodies at him, paused and chattered to see if he would respond, and, when he didn't, linked arms and sauntered on towards the town, leaving Bond wondering why it was that French girls had more prominent navels than any others. Was it that French surgeons sought to add, even in this minute respect, to the future sex-appeal of girl babies?</p> <p>And now, up and down the beach, the lifeguards gave a final blast on their horns to announce that they were going off duty, the music from the piscine stopped in mid-tune and the great expanse of sand was suddenly deserted.</p> <p>But not quite! A hundred yards out, lying face down-wards on a black and white striped bathing-wrap, on the private patch of firm sand where she had installed herself an hour before, the girl was still there, motion-less, spread-eagled in direct line between James Bond and the setting sun that was now turning the left-behind pools and shallow rivulets into blood-red, meandering scrawls across the middle distance. Bond went on watching her - now, in the silence and emptiness, with an ounce more tension. He was waiting for her to do something - for something, he didn't know what, to happen. It would be more true to say that he was watching over her. He had an instinct that she was in some sort of danger. Or was it just that there was the smell of danger in the air? He didn't know. He only knew that he mustn't leave her alone, particularly now that everyone else had gone.</p> <p>James Bond was mistaken. Not everyone else had gone. Behind him, at the Cafe de la Plage on the other side of the promenade, two men in raincoats and dark caps sat at a secluded table bordering the sidewalk. They had half-empty cups of coffee in front of them and they didn't talk. They sat and watched the blur on the frosted-glass partition of the shelter that was James Bond's head and shoulders. They also watched, but less intently, the distant white blur on the sand that was the girl. Their stillness, and their unseasonable clothes, would have made a disquieting impression on anyone who, in his turn, might have been watching them. But there was no such person, except their waiter who had simply put them in the category of 'bad news' and hoped they would soon be on their way.</p> <p>When the lower rim of the orange sun touched the sea, it was almost as if a signal had sounded for the girl. She slowly got to her feet, ran both hands backwards through her hair and began to walk evenly, purposefully towards the sun and the far-away froth of the water-line over a mile away. It would be violet dusk by the time she reached the sea and one might have guessed that this was probably the last day of her holiday, her last bathe.</p> <p>James Bond thought otherwise. He left his shelter, ran down the steps to the sand and began walking out after her at a fast pace. Behind him, across the promenade, the two men in raincoats also seemed to think otherwise. One of them briskly threw down some coins and they both got up and, walking strictly in step, crossed the promenade to the sand and, with a kind of urgent military precision, marched rapidly side by side in Bond's tracks.</p> <p>Now the strange pattern of figures on the vast expanse of empty, blood-streaked sand was eerily conspicuous. Yet it was surely not one to be interfered with! The pattern had a nasty, a secret smell. The white girl, the bare-headed young man, the two squat, marching pursuers - it had something of a kind of deadly Grand-mother's Steps about it. In the cafe, the waiter collected the coins and looked after the distant figures, still outlined by the last quarter of the orange sun. It smelt like police business - or the other thing. He would keep it to himself but remember it. He might get his name in the papers.</p> <p>James Bond was rapidly catching up with the girl. Now he knew that he would get to her just as she reached the waterline. He began to wonder what he would say to her, how he would put it. He couldn't say, 'I had a hunch you were going to commit suicide so I came after you to stop you.' 'I was going for a walk on the beach and I thought I recognised you. Will you have a drink after your swim?' would be childish. He l finally decided to say,' Oh, Tracy!' and then, when she turned round, 'I was worried about you.' Which would at least be inoffensive and, for the matter of that, true.</p> <p>The sea was now gunmetal below a primrose horizon. A small, westerly offshore breeze, drawing the hot land-air out to sea, had risen and was piling up wavelets that scrolled in whitely as far as the eye could see. Flocks of herring gulls lazily rose and settled again at the girl's approach, and the air was full of their mewing and of the endless lap-lap of the small waves. The soft indigo dusk added a touch of melancholy to the empty solitude of sand and sea, now so far away from the comforting bright lights and holiday bustle of 'La Reine de la Cote Opale', as Royale-les-Eaux had splendidly christened herself. Bond looked forward to getting the girl back to those bright lights. He watched the lithe golden figure in the white one-piece bathing-suit and wondered how soon she would be able to hear his voice above the noise of the gulls and the sea. Her pace had slowed a fraction as she approached the water-line and her head, with its bell of heavy fair hair to the shoulders, was slightly bowed, in thought perhaps, or tiredness.</p> <p>Bond quickened his step until he was on...</p></p><h2>Everything Lawn Care (Everything Series)</h2><p>Keeping your yard in prime condition isn't always easy.

Nina Simonds, known for her impeccable versions of classic Asian dishes, cuts loose in this book, offering, for example, a creative seafood and rice salad tucked into lettuce leaves and a clever adaptation of Chinese Lion's Head. This dish is usually meatballs with a mane of cabbage, served floating in a soupy casserole; Simonds transforms it into stuffed cabbage rolls served with the rich broth in which they cook. For bite-size appetizers, there are skewers of grilled pork sï¿½tï¿½, unexpectedly enveloped in radicchio leaves, a more classic Flaky Curry Turnover filled with ground meat and green peas, and colorful smoked salmon spirals filled with sushi rice, capers, and red onion. <p> Going still further afield, Simonds fuses Asian and Caribbean flavors in her Chinese Jerk Chicken in a flour tortilla, including ginger, scallion, and rice vinegar in the jerk paste. Her Hawaii-style grilled swordfish kebabs served with pineapple salsa almost dare you to skip the wrapper and enjoy the lightly soy-sauce-marinated fish simply with its piquant accompaniment. As in her previous book, <i>Asian Noodles</i>, Simonds details all you need to know about special ingredients, covering 17 kinds of wrappers, from wonton skins and rice paper to lotus leaves and Indian flatbread. To make dishes accessible to everyone, particularly when there is not an Asian food store nearby, Simonds offers more readily available tortillas, pita bread, and lavash as substitutions. <i>Asian Wraps</i> resembles other recent books by Simonds, including <i>A Spoonful of Ginger</i>, in its generous use of beautifully styled color photos of prepared dishes and key ingredients. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i></p><p>Nina Simonds is a regular contributor to <i>Gourmet</i> and <i>Eating Well</i> magazines and the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>.

Lovecraft</h2><p>Explore the marvelous complexity of Lovecraft's writing&#x2014;including his use of literary allusions, biographical details, and obscure references in this rich, in-depth exploration of great horror fiction from the acknowledged master of the weird, including the stories "Herbert West&#x2014;Reanimator", "Pickman's Model", "The Call of Cthulhu", "The Thing on the Doorstep", "The Horror at Red Hook" and more.<br><br>Did Lovecraft believe in ghosts or paranormal phenomena? In what story does the narrator fear riding the Boston T?<br><br>A pathfinder in the literary territory of the macabre, H.P. Lovecraft is one of America's giants of the horror genre. Now, in this second volume of annotated tales, Lovecraft scholars S. T. Joshi and Peter Cannon provide another rare opportunity to look into the mind of a genius. Their extensive notes lift the veil between real events in the writer's life&#x2014;such as the death of his father&#x2014;and the words that spill out onto the page in magnificent grotesquerie. Mansions, universities, laboratories, and dank New England boneyards appear also as the haunts where Lovecraft's characters confront the fabulous and fantastic, or&#x2014;like the narrator in "Herbert West&#x2014;Reanimator"&#x2014;dig up fresh corpses. <br><br>Richly illustrated and scrupulously researched, this extraordinary work adds exciting levels of meaning to Lovecraft's chilling tales . . . and increases our wonder at the magic that transforms life into a great writer's art.</p><p>Following in the footsteps of the 1997 <i>The Annotated H.P. Lovecraft</i>, Lovecraft experts S.T. Joshi and Peter Cannon again pay testament to their favorite horror writer, annotating and illustrating 10 of his stories. <i>More Annotated H.P. Lovecraft</i> includes such classic horror stories as "Herbert Westï¿½Reanimator," "Pickman's Model," "The Call of Cthulhu," and "The Horror at Red Hook." The book also includes several obscure references and photographs of places Lovecraft mentioned throughout his works. This is particularly fascinating, since the popular horror writer used many settings from buildings in his neighborhood, including the house where his aunt lived. <p> At the beginning of each story is a note on where and when the story was first published, and whether it had been previously rejected by another publisher. Joshi and Cannon also dissect each work, asking such questions as, How did Lovecraft invent the name Herbert West? And, How did Lovecraft create the names of fictional rivers and universities in New England? These questions are well-traced and investigated, a real treat for Lovecraft fans. <i>--Samantha Allen Storey</i></p>Almost completely ignored by the mainstream press during his lifetime, H.P. Lovecraft (1890-1937) has since come to be recognized as one of the greatest writers of classic horror, on a par with Edgar Allan Poe, Lovecraft&#39;s mentor. H. P. Lovecraft&#39;s work has been translated into more than a dozen languages, his tales adapted for film, television, and comic books, and he has been the subject of more scholarly study than any other writer of horror fiction save Poe.</p><h2>Fun Is a Feeling</h2><p>Awaken your child&#39;s imagination to viewing everyday events in magical ways by following a trail of stardust.

Cash: "I can't stand it anymore, and I don't even know what <i>it</i> is." In 1964, rightwing maven Phyllis Schlafly published a book called <i>A Choice, Not an Echo</i> in which she condemned President Lyndon B. Johnson for awarding the Medal of Freedom to the leftwing literary critic Edmund Wilson. Among her objections to Wilson, Schlafly noted: "Edmund Wilson revealed his lack of patriotism in these words from his latest book ( <i>The Cold War and the Income Tax</i>): 'I have finally come to feel that this country, whether or not I continue to live in it, is no longer any place for me.'" It's time Schlafly knew that Alexander Hamilton said it first. In a letter to Governor Clinton of New York he wrote: "Every day proves to me more and more that this American world was not made for me." Moreover, in another letter to Rufus King, Hamilton said: "Am I a fool--a romantic Quixote--or is there a constitutional defect in the American mind?" Like all members of the God 'n' Country Club, Schlaflythinks that only leftwing teeth are set on edge by America. She's wrong. I'm slightly to the right of Baby Doc, but life in America has the same effect on me as "The Morton Downey, Jr. Show." Alexander Hamilton was neither a fool nor a romantic Quixote. According to the laws of logic, A is A; a thing cannot be other than itself; parallel lines cannot meet. Except in America, where the movement of Birnam Wood to Dunsinane is a regular occurrence in the lumberyard of our national psyche. Unstrung Americans are found in both political camps, and our common motto is: "My nerves, right or wrong." This book is about my nerves and the lumberyard. That's not a good title, however, so I called it <i>Reflections in a jaundiced Eye.</i> REFLECTIONS IN A JAUNDICED EYE. Copyright ï¿½ 1989 by Florence King. All rights reserved.

But d'Eon was lying. In fact he was a man pretending to be a woman who was now admitting to be a man. Why he did that and what happened to him as a result are the main dishes on Mr. Kates's rich banquet table." -- Richard Bernstein, New York Times, reviewing Monsieur d'Eon Is a Woman by Gary Kates</p><p>Chevalier d'Eon de Beaumont was born in 1728. Raised as a boy, he was educated as a lawyer and entered the service of Louis XV as a diplomat. In 1756 he was sent to the Russian imperial court as a spy and was said to have dressed as a young woman to gain the confidence of the Empress Elizabeth. He later served in Russia (as a man) as secretary to the French ambassador. Returning to France in 1761, he was appointed a captain of the elite Dragoons, and, after the Treaty of Paris in 1762, went to England as a diplomat and spy. During that time persistent rumors that he was in fact a woman arose, and he did nothing to dispel them. By 1777 he was officially recognized as female in both England and France. Recalled to France, he was reluctantly compelled by Louis XVI to give up his male attire. In 1785 he began to compose his autobiography, which presented much of his experience in religious terms, and he moved back to London. He lived there as a woman until his death in 1810, at which time his body was discovered to be unambiguously male.</p><p>This volume includes the first English translations of d'Eon's autobiography (or "historical epistle") and other writings by d'Eon on his life, religious beliefs, and stories of women who concealed their sex to enter religious orders. As historian Gary Kates notes in the introduction, d'Eon's writing can be read on at least two levels: while it ostensibly tells the story of a woman who spent half her life as a man, it is in fact also the story of a man who spent half his life as a woman. As such it demonstrates both the construction and transgression of gender boundaries in personal and historical narrative.</p></p><p><p>Charles-Geneviï¿½ve-Louise-Auguste-Andrï¿½-Timothï¿½e d'Eon de Beaumont (1728--1810) was a well-known statesman, diplomat, spy, author, and military officer.

Her first novel, <i>De Feniks</i>, was published in Dutch in 2005.MAY 12, 2006<br><br>The world was exactly as it should be. No more and definitely no less. She had the love of a good man. A house. And her own money--still new and fresh and the healthiest shade of green--the thought of it buoyed her and gave her a rush that made her hum.<br><br>These same streets she had walked before seemed to have acquired a certain newness. Humming, relishing the notion of new beginnings, she thought of how much her life was changing: Luc. Money. A house. She was already becoming someone else. Metamorphosing, she told herself, recalling the word from a biology class. Sloughing off a life that no longer suited her.<br><br>What she did not know, what she would find out only hours from now, was just how absolute the transition would be.<br><br>Sisi navigated the Keyserlei and imagined everything she could buy with her brand-new wealth. It would buy her forgetfulness, even from those memories that did not permit silence, making her yell in her sleep so that she woke up restless, wanting to cry. Now the shops sparkled and called to her, and she answered, touching things that took her fancy, marveling in the snatches of freedom, heady with a joy that emitted light around her and made her surer than ever that the Prophecy was undoubtedly true. This was the true epiphany. Not the one she had on a certain Wednesday night on the Vingerlingstraat. That one was a pseudo-epiphany. She knew that now.<br><br>She was hungry and stood undecided between the Panos and the Ekxi on the Keyserlei. Her new life smiled at her, benevolent and lush. It nudged her toward the Ekxi, with its price a notch higher than Panos's. She went in and bought a sandwich with lettuce spilling out the sides, ruffled and moist. To go with it, a bottle of thick fruit cocktail. She sat at a table outside, her shopping bags at her feet; the bags shimmied in the light spring breeze, evidence of her break from a parsimonious past. What should she get? Maybe a gift for Luc. A curtain for his doorless room. Imagine a room without a door! Ha! The architect who designed the house had a thing for space and light, and since Luc was coming out of a depression when he bought the house, he had been certain that space and light were the very things he needed. The lack of a door had not disturbed him in the least. "Rooms must have doors," Sisi told him when he showed her around the house. "Or curtains, at the very least!" Luc had said nothing in response. And silence was acquiescence. Certainly. Curtains with a frenetic design of triangles and squares, bold purple and white splashes against a cocoa brown, found in the HEMA. She imagined what the other women would say of Luc's doorless bedroom. She imagined their incredulous laughter. And that was enough to feed a guilt that she was trying hard to stop. She hadn't abandoned them. Had she? She had just . . . well, moved on. Surely, surely, she had that right. Still, she wondered: What were they doing now? When would they notice that she was gone?<br>In a house on the Zwartezusterstraat, the women Sisi was thinking of--Ama, Joyce, and Efe--were at that very moment preparing for work, rushing in and out of the bathroom, swelling its walls with their expectations: that tonight they would do well; that the men who came would be a multitude; that they would not be too demanding. And more than that, that they would be generous.<br><br>"Who has my mascara? Where's my fucking mascara?" Ama shouted, emptying a makeup bag on the tile floor. Joyce was at the same time stuffing a denim duffel bag with a deodorant spray, a beach towel, a duster, and her Smiley, so nicknamed by Sisi. Smiley was a lubricant gel, innocuously packaged in a plastic see-through teddy bear with an orange conical hat and a wide smile; it might have been a child's bottle of glue. She blocked her mother's face, looking aghast at Smiley, her lips rounding to form a name that was not Joyce.<br><br>"Where's Sisi?" she asked.<br><br>"I haven't seen her. Maybe she don' leave already," Efe said, putting an electric toothbrush into a toilet bag. In an inner pocket of the bag was a picture of a boy in a baseball cap. On the back of the photograph were the initials L.I. The picture was wrinkled and the gloss had worn off, but when it was first sent to her it would have been easy to see (in the shine of the gloss that highlighted a broad forehead) that the boy bore a close semblance to her. The way a son might his mother. She carried this picture everywhere.<br><br>They still had a bit of time before they had to leave, but they liked to get ready early. There were things that could not be rushed. Looking good was one. They did not want to turn up at work looking half asleep and with half of their gear forgotten.<br><br>"How come Sisi left so early?" Joyce asked.<br><br>"Who knows?" Ama answered, running her hand quickly across her neck as if to assure herself that the gold chain that she always wore was still there. "All this Sisi, Sisi, Sisi, are you lovers? Maybe she's gone on one of her walks."<br><br>Ama laughed, slitting her eyes to brush on mascara.<br><br>Sisi went out alone at least twice a week, refusing company when it was offered. Nobody knew where she went except that she sometimes came back with boxes of chocolate and bags of Japanese fans and baby booties embroidered in lace, fridge magnets and T-shirts with Belgian beer logos printed on them. "Gifts," she mumbled angrily when Joyce asked her once who they were for.<br><br>Joyce was already out of the bathroom. She had hoped Sisi would help her cornrow her hair. In between perm and braids, her hair was a wilderness that would not be subdued. Neither Ama nor Efe could braid. Nothing for it now, she would have to hold it in a bun and hope that Madam would not notice that the bun was an island in the middle of her head, surrounded by insubordinate hair that scattered every which way. If Sisi had not left, if she was simply running late, she would have Madam to answer to. For Sisi's sake, Joyce hoped she would be back on time. How could anyone forget what Madam had done to Efe the night she turned up for work late? Nothing could excuse her behavior, Madam said. Not even the fact of her grandmother's death.<br>ZWARTEZUSTERSTRAAT<br><br>It was not every death that earned a party. But if the departed was old and beloved, then a party was very much in order. Efe's grandmother was both. And since she was too far away to attend the burial herself, the next best thing, the expected thing, was a big party. Plus, in dismal November, nothing could beat a good party.<br><br>Efe did not tell Madam of the death. Or of the party. Nobody told Madam anything. It was not like, if she were invited, she would attend anyway.<br><br>The girls had started the day in the kitchen doing dishes from the previous day. Sisi's laughter was the loudest, rising and drowning out the voices of the other women. She slapped her thighs with a damp kitchen towel, and the strength of the laughter shut her eyes. "Tell me, Efe, your aunty really believed her husband?"<br><br>"Yes. She did. He told her she could not go abroad with him because the British embassy required her GCSE results before they would give her a visa. Dat na de only way he could tink of to stop her wahalaing him about traveling with him. Four wives, and she wanted him to pick her above the rest? And she no be even the chief wife. Imagine!

Saves you a lot of trouble and time," Joyce said, placing a drinking glass she had just dried in the cupboard above her head.<br><br>"Men are bastards," Ama said.<br><br>"Ama, lighten up. Since when did this story become about men being bastards, eh? Everything has to be so serious with you; you know how to spoil a good day. You just have to get worked up over nothing!" Sisi wiped a plate dry, examined it for smudges, and finding none, placed it on top of another on the work surface beside the sink.<br><br>Ama turned toward Sisi and hissed. "Move the plates, abeg. If you leave them there, they'll only get wet again. Why don't you put them away as soon as you've dried?" She hissed again and went to work scrubbing a pot in the kitchen sink. "How could you burn rice, Sisi? I can't get the fucking pot clean!"<br><br>"I don't know what's eating you up, Ama, but I don't want any part of it. Whoever sent you, tell them you didn't see me, I beg of you."<br><br>"Fuck off. Why don't you fuck off on one of your long walks?" Ama's voice was a storm building.<br><br>Efe tried to calm the storm. "Girls, girls, it's a beautiful day. Make una no ruin am!" She hoped it would not rain. It was a beautiful day for November: leaves turned aubergine-purple and yellow and white by a mild autumn and a sky that did not forebode rain. A minor miracle for the time of year. "See as de day just dey like fine picture, and una wan spoil am?"<br><br>"Nobody's ruining anything. Anyway, I'm done here." Ama pulled out the now gleaming pot and walked out of the kitchen into the sitting room. She flooded the room with the twang boom bam of a Highlife tune. She lit a cigarette and began to dance.<br><br>Efe, swishing a kitchen towel over her head, sighed and followed her into the sitting room. "I can see you don' dey get ready for the party, Ama. Oooh, shake that booty, girl! Shake am like your mama teach you!"<br><br>"Oh, shut it! What has my mother got to do with my dancing?" Ama moved away from Efe, the crucifix around her neck glinting. Her anger seemed blown up. Exaggerated. But Efe let it pass. She had other things on her mind.<br><br>The party, for starters. The Moroccan man who had promised to get her cartons of beer at a discount had just called to say that his contact had not come through. Now the drinks would cost her a lot more than she had budgeted for. The girls had promised to help her with the food, but with Ama in this mood, she might have one fewer pair of hands. Everything had to go to plan today. A burial ceremony for her grandmother had to be talked about for months to come. That was how much she loved the woman. And they were not even related. ...</p><h2>This Is Not About Me</h2><p><p>When her mother left her alcoholic father and set up home in a tiny attic room above a doctor&#x2019;s surgery, Janice Galloway quickly learned how to keep quiet and stay out of the way. Her mother hadn&#x2019;t expected or wanted another child and Galloway wasn&#x2019;t allowed to forget that she was a burden. Her much older sister Cora, with her steady stream of boyfriends, her showy fashions, and erratic temperament, never failed to remind her of her insignificance. Galloway&#x2019;s Scottish childhood is defined by the intimate details of her environment, where every family member looms close.&nbsp;With startling precision she remembers scenes of domestic life: her mother&#x2019;s weekly round of washing, the sodden tweed dripping on the line; Cora putting on layers of make up for the Ayrshire night life; learning to write and control the often rebellious letters; the living quality of her mother&#x2019;s mangy old fur coat.&nbsp;In these cramped conditions, ignored by her elders, Galloway is a silent observer, carefully and keenly watching the people around her. As her rage grows, she begins to think for herself. Slowly, unexpectedly, she finds her voice. Out of the silent child emerges the girl who will be a writer.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Janice Galloway&#x2019;s previous books include the novels <i>The Trick is to Keep Breathing</i>, shortlisted for the Whitbread First Novel Award; and <i>Clara</i> which won the 2004 Saltire Book of the Year Award.</p>&#39;Sublime prose and fierce honesty set it apart - Part of Galloway&#39;s skill in This is Not About Me is how she keeps a child&#39;s sense of bewilderment and secret understanding&#39; -Telegraph&#39;Blistering, terrifying, always moving&#39; - Independent on Sunday&#39;Galloway provides sentences blazing with light, a gorgeous draft of terror&#39; Observer&#39;Galloway takes her readers straight back into childhood&#39;s wincingly recognisable uncertainties, dislocations and disruptions.

During the Great Depression, it campaigned to raise labor standards in the unregulated, non-union South, hoping to discourage the relocation of manufacturers to the region because of cheaper labor and to break the downward spiral of labor standards nationwide. Promoting regulation of men's labor as well as women's, the league shaped the National Recovery Administration codes and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 but still battled the National Woman's Party, whose proposed equal rights amendment threatened sex-based labor laws.<br><br>Using the National Consumers' League as a window on the nation's evolving reform tradition, <i>Civilizing Capitalism</i> explores what progressive feminists hoped for from the New Deal and why, despite significant victories, they ultimately were disappointed.<br><br></p><p>"Storrs probes a heretofore neglected period in NCL activity. . . .

In the course of his long career in the northern Italian city of Cremona, he created more than a thousand stringed instruments; approximately six hundred survive. In this fascinating book, Toby Faber traces the rich, multilayered stories of six of these peerless instruments&#x2013;five violins and a cello&#x2013;and the one towering artist who brought them into being.<br><br>Blending history, biography, meticulous detective work, and an abiding passion for music, Faber embarks on an absorbing journey as he follows some of the most prized instruments of all time. Mysteries and unanswered questions proliferate from the outset&#x2013;starting with the enigma of Antonio Stradivari himself. What made this apparently unsophisticated craftsman so special? Why were his techniques not maintained by his successors? How is it that even two and a half centuries after his death, no one has succeeded in matching the purity, depth, and delicacy of a Stradivarius?<br><br>In Faber&#x2019;s illuminating narrative, each of the six fabled instruments becomes a character in its own right&#x2013;a living entity cherished by artists, bought and sold by princes and plutocrats, coveted, collected, hidden, lost, copied, and occasionally played by a musician whose skill matches its maker&#x2019;s.<br><br>Here is the fabulous Viotti, named for the virtuoso who enchanted all Paris in the 1780s, only to fall foul of the French Revolution. Paganini supposedly made a pact with the devil to transform the art of the violin&#x2013;and by the end of his life he owned eleven Strads. Then there&#x2019;s the Davidov cello, fashioned in 1712 and lovingly handed down through a succession of celebrated artists until, in the 1980s, it passed into the capable hands of Yo-Yo Ma. <br><br>From the salons of Vienna to the concert halls of New York, from the breakthroughs of Beethoven&#x2019;s last quartets to the first phonographic recordings, Faber unfolds a narrative magnificent in its range and brilliant in its detail. &#x201c;A great violin is alive,&#x201d; said Yehudi Menuhin of his own Stradivarius. In the pages of this book, Faber invites us to share the life, the passion, the intrigue, and the incomparable beauty of the world&#x2019;s most marvelous stringed instruments.</p><p>Born in Cambridge, England, in 1965, <b>TOBY FABER</b> now lives in London with his wife and daughter. He was previously managing director of his family&#x2019;s renowned publishing firm, Faber and Faber. This is his first book.Chapter One<br><br>Five violins<br><br>and one cello<br><br>The Messiah, the Viotti, the Khevenhï¿½ller, the Paganini, the Lipiï¿½nski, and the Davidov<br>THE MESSIAH<br><br>Oxford&#x2019;s Ashmolean Museum, founded in 1683, is the oldest institution of its kind in Britain. From Elias Ashmole&#x2019;s original bequest, it has gone on to establish an enviable reputation for excellence in research and teaching, with an appearance impressive enough to match. Wide stone steps lead up to a grand, if slightly austere, classical faï¿½ade. The Ashmolean may be smaller than London&#x2019;s British Museum, or New York&#x2019;s Metropolitan Museum of Art, but the overall effect is similar. You feel a proper sense of awe even before stepping over the threshold. Once you do, and if you&#x2019;re lucky, the guard on duty at the front door will tell you the shortcut: don&#x2019;t go up the main stairs but turn left, go to the end of the gallery, take the stairs you see on your right, and the Hill Music Room is immediately at the top on the first floor. On your arrival, as likely as not, the room will be shut, with a sign on the door blaming staff shortages and suggesting that, if you particularly wish to see the room&#x2019;s contents, you should try the invigilator next door.<br><br>It is an unpropitious beginning. When you manage to get in, you will find a room only perhaps fifteen by thirty feet. On hot days there will be a fan in the corner to compensate for the lack of air-conditioning. The cork tiles on the floor are scuffed about; protruding nails catch the unwary foot. Curious Old Masters with little obvious connection to music line the walls above the harpsichords and virginals that make up the less interesting part of the Hill Collection. Elsewhere, one case contains bows, while another includes a guitar made by Stradivari himself. It is plain but superbly constructed&#x2014;testimony to its maker&#x2019;s range, but far from being the main attraction. In the middle of the room a further case is crowded with eight violins, a viola, and a bass viol. One of the violins was made by Andrea Amati in 1564, part of a commission for Charles IX of France. It is the oldest surviving violin in the world, an exquisite piece of workmanship. The Civic Museum in Cremona has one from the same set, but dated 1566, that was recently valued at $10 million. The Ashmolean&#x2019;s example has been laid on its back to fit into the case, obscuring what remains of the gilded painting with which the violin was decorated.<br><br>Almost every exhibit in this display would be the highlight of another museum&#x2019;s collection, but here they are no more than also-rans to the star, the only instrument to get its own cabinet, the one that greets you as you walk through the door: the Messiah. There it hangs, suspended in its case, visible from every angle, pristine, its varnish as flawless as when Stradivari applied the last few drops in 1716. It is in mint condition because this, the most famous violin in the world, template for countless copies, has hardly ever been played.<br><br>THE VIOTTI<br><br>On May 6, 1990, Thomas Bowes gave a recital at the Purcell Room, a small concert hall in London. He was playing a violin he called the Viotti&#x2013;Marie Hall, after two previous owners. Its looks alone were striking: the immaculate maple back had natural horizontal stripes whose effect Bowes describes as almost psychedelic. But it is the sound that he most remembers now: &#x201c;That violin was absolutely deafening to play; when you played a sort of high harmonic in G or something on the E string you would actually be slightly in pain; it was so focused; it was like a sort of laser beam. . . . It gave an incredible feeling of power just to know that the smallest touch would just ping out to the back of the biggest hall. . . . There was a kind of awesome perfection about it.&#x201d;<br><br>Bowes&#x2019;s recital was billed as revisiting the golden age of the violin: the Edwardian era when musicians faced no competition from modern technology for the ears of their prosperous audience. One of the Strad&#x2019;s eponymous owners, Marie Hall, had been a leading English violinist in the early twentieth century. The recital consisted mainly of music that she would have played, exhibition pieces by some of the great nineteenth-century violinist-composers: Paganini, Spohr, Vieuxtemps, Ernst, and Wieniawski. As for the violin&#x2019;s connection with Viotti, Europe&#x2019;s most influential violinist at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the program had this to say: &#x201c;The Viotti Stradivarius of 1709 was used by Viotti until his death, when it was sold in Paris with other instruments in his possession. Viotti was perhaps one of the first great players to fully appreciate the merits of Stradivarius. The &#x2018;Marie Hall&#x2019; ex Viotti Stradivarius is said to have been Viotti&#x2019;s favorite instrument and is reputed to be the instrument he used when he first visited Paris. It is a magnificent violin, with superb tone; a perfect Stradivarius in every respect.&#x201d; It is our second violin.<br><br>THE KHEVENHï¿½LLER<br><br>Urbane and charming, with a penchant for expensive cigars and a fund of amusing stories, Peter Biddulph is everything one expects a violin expert to be. His dealership has a fine address in London&#x2019;s West End, and its safe has played host to violins that most players can only covet. He is one of the few dealers in the world who can identify the real thing with confidence and who have the reputation to match their skill. Biddulph&#x2019;s habit of conducting transactions at either end of a trip on the Concorde earned him, in happier times, the nickname Flying Fiddle. Nowadays he probably regrets the double entendre. A case brought by the heirs of Gerald Segelman, whose violin collection Biddulph helped to disperse after its owner&#x2019;s death, ended in an out-of-court settlement of ï¿½3 million [$4.5 million].* Biddulph had to sell the building that houses his London shop, although he still operates from the basement and a ground-floor reception area. Nevertheless he protests his innocence of anything more serious than bad record-keeping; it was, he says, only his inability to afford a protracted case that led to the settlement.<br><br>The Segelman affair has turned an unwelcome spotlight on violin dealers and their role as the final arbiters of authenticity and value. Biddulph could be forgiven for avoiding questions. Nevertheless he is happy to talk, over a mint tea, about the Khevenhï¿½ller, the third of our violins, which he sold in 2000 on behalf of one of the oldest violin shops in Japan.<br><br>The Khevenhï¿½ller Stradivarius was made in 1733, a late masterpiece. One previous owner describes it as &#x201c;ample and round, varnished a deep glowing red, its grand proportions . . . matched by a sound at once powerful, mellow and sweet.&#x201d; In the last twenty years it has changed hands many times; this was the second time that Biddulph acted as intermediary. On this occasion it was valued at $4 million. Another dealer had shown it to Maxim Vengerov. He &#x201c;loved it,&#x201d; but not enough, apparently, to make him give up the Kreutzer. To my mind, we should admire him for refusing to abandon his &#x201c;marriage&#x201d; for a new paramour. Jaime Laredo, the Bolivian American violinist, also tried the Khevenhï¿½ller. He too &#x201c;would have loved it&#x201d; as a partner to his other great Strad, the Gariel, made in 1717. But he could not raise the funds. Who could afford an asking price like that?<br><br>THE PAGANINI<br><br>&#x201c;If the Tokyo String Quartet isn&#x2019;t the world&#x2019;s greatest chamber music ensemble, it&#x2019;s hard to imagine which group is.&#x201d; Unsurprisingly, the quartet&#x2019;s publicity likes to repeat that quote from The Washington Post. Less definitive but almost as flattering reviews remark on both the group&#x2019;s succulent tone and a cohesiveness that persists despite the numerous changes of personnel since the ensemble&#x2019;s formation in 1969. It would be pleasing to think that both these attributes may partly result from another fact, also repeated in every press release: since 1995 the Tokyo Quartet has played the same set of instruments, all made by Stradivari, the Paganini Quartet.<br><br>Named after the nineteenth-century Italian virtuoso who once owned all four instruments, the Paganini Quartet has a legendary status that is almost matched by the quality of its constituent pieces. Stradivari only made two or three great violas, and the Quartet&#x2019;s, made in 1731, is one of them. The first violin, four years older, was described by Paganini as having a tone as big as a double bass; it too is recognized as a masterpiece. The cello&#x2019;s label dates it to 1736, the year before its maker&#x2019;s death, although many place it earlier. It has the reputation of being among the best works of Stradivari&#x2019;s last years, with perfect proportions that hark back to an earlier era of the Master&#x2019;s life.<br><br>In such exalted company the second violin, made around 1680, is an oddity. Stradivari&#x2019;s early works are generally thought to be in a lower league than his more mature output, and this violin&#x2014;the 1680 Paganini&#x2014;is fifty years older than its counterparts in the Quartet. A string quartet is a partnership of equals. The second violin should never be of poorer quality than the instruments with which it must balance. The answer to why the 1680 Paganini became part of the Quartet lies in its history. It is our fourth violin.<br><br>THE LIPIï¿½NSKI<br><br>For two hundred years the 1715 Lipiï¿½nski boasted a succession of famous players. One of the biggest violins Stradivari produced, made when he was at his peak, its construction speaks of its maker&#x2019;s confidence, and the longevity of its fame is surely evidence of his genius. But for more than fifty years it has figured in no performances. Since its last recorded sale in 1962, the Lipi&#x12;...</p><h2>The Civil War Diary of Gideon Welles, Lincoln&#39;s Secretary of the Navy: The Original Manuscript Edition (The Knox College Lincoln Studies Center)</h2><p>Gideon Welles&#x2019;s 1861 appointment as secretary of the navy placed him at the hub of Union planning for the Civil War and in the midst of the powerful personalities vying for influence in Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s cabinet. Although Welles initially knew little of naval matters, he rebuilt a service depleted by Confederate defections, planned actions that gave the Union badly needed victories in the war&#x2019;s early days, and oversaw a blockade that weakened the South&#x2019;s economy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps the hardest-working member of the cabinet, Welles still found time to keep a detailed diary that has become one of the key documents for understanding the inner workings of the Lincoln administration. In this new edition, William E. and Erica L. Gienapp have restored Welles&#x2019;s original observations, gleaned from the manuscript diaries at the Library of Congress and freed from his many later revisions, so that the reader can experience what he wrote in the moment. With his vitriolic pen, Welles captures the bitter disputes over strategy and war aims, lacerates colleagues from Secretary of State William H. Seward to General-in-Chief Henry Halleck, and condemns the actions of the self-serving southern elite he sees as responsible for the war. He can just as easily wax eloquent about the Navy's wartime achievements, extoll the virtues of Lincoln, or drop in a tidbit of Washington gossip.<br> &nbsp;<br> Carefully edited and extensively annotated, this edition contains a wealth of supplementary material. The several appendixes include short biographies of the members of Lincoln&#x2019;s cabinet, the retrospective Welles wrote after leaving office covering the period missing from the diary proper, and important letters regarding naval matters and international law.<br></p><p>The definitive edition of an essential Civil War document<br>William E.

The aurora's physics, too, is awesome: high energy particles streaming from the sun are captured and focused by Earth's magnetic field to collide with and excite gas molecules; as they return to a stable energy state, photons are emitted, creating colorful visible light. Souza's lucid explanation of the phenomenon is generously illustrated with clear diagrams, maps, and superb color photos. Except during solar flares and unusual solar activity, only Americans in the northern states can experience the aurora directly; this book may inspire a special trip. A beautifully presented example of a relatively narrow slice of science that nicely illuminates wider topics. Glossary; index. (Nonfiction. 10+) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Gr. 5-7. The photo-essay format is attractive, with large, mysterious pictures of skies in dazzling light and color, but the physics of what causes the Northern Lights isn't easy to understand. It does help that Souza tries to explain the action of solar-wind particles, magnetic fields, and atmospheric gases in terms of daily things around the house, from images on the TV screen to the action of neon lights and the swirling of clothes in the drier. She also includes information on where and when the auroras can be seen, a folklore section of fascinating facts, and a glossary.

She excelled, so the doctor who supervised the selection of NASA&#39;s Mercury astronauts recruited additional female pilots. Twelve performed exceptionally. Stephanie Nolen tracked down eleven of the surviving &#34;Fellow Lady Astronaut Trainees&#34; and learned the story of those early days of the space race and the disappointment when, in 1961, the women were grounded.</p><p><b>Stephanie Nolen</b> is the South African bureau chief for The Globe and Mail. She reports on the developing world and covered the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. She is the coauthor of Shakespeare's Face.In one of those strange coincidences that often occur in publishing, this is the second book this summer (after Martha Ackmann's The Mercury 13) to relate the little known but remarkable story of the 13 women who trained in the early 1960s to be Mercury astronauts, and though a slightly less satisfying effort, this is still compelling reading. These women passed many of the same grueling tests taken by the male Mercury astronauts, but they were opposed by virtually everyone in power at NASA. In addition to bringing many of the 13 to life, Nolen, a foreign correspondent for Canada's Toronto Globe and Mail, does an excellent job of describing the social context in which they operated. She explains that although institutional sexism and a strong antifemale bias among most players at NASA certainly existed, American society at large was not yet ready to permit women to be placed in the roles for which these women were training. Even many women felt this way, and Nolen explains how Jackie Cochran, one of America's best-known female aviators, spoke forcefully against sending women into space. Cochran's motives, according to Nolen, were complex; she didn't want to antagonize powerful male friends, she didn't want other women to overshadow her achievements and she felt that women weren't physically capable of performing such activities. Although Nolen interviewed 11 of the original 13, her material isn't quite as personal as Ackmann's.

Is something bothering you?&#x201d; Amalia&#x2019;s grandmother removed the boiling honey from the stovetop to let it cool. Then she wiped her forehead with a tissue and looked at her granddaughter. The light from the setting sun entered the small window over the sink with a soft glow. The geraniums on the windowsill added a subtle hint of pink. &#x201c;You are too quiet, hijita. Tell me what&#x2019;s bothering you,&#x201d; her grandmother insisted. &#x201c;It is obvious that something is wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, Abuelita, de verdad. I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>Amalia tried to sound convincing, but her grandmother continued, &#x201c;Is it because Martha did not come with you today? Is she all right?&#x201d;<br> <br>Going to her grandmother&#x2019;s home on Friday afternoon was something Amalia had been doing since she was little. For the last two years, since they started fourth grade, her friend Martha accompanied her most Fridays. Every week Amalia looked forward to the time she spent at her grandmother&#x2019;s house. But today was different.<br> <br>Amalia paused before answering, &#x201c;She is not coming back anymore, Abuelita. ï¿½Nunca mï¿½s!&#x201d; Despite Amalia&#x2019;s efforts to control her feelings, her voice cracked and her brown eyes watered.<br> <br>&#x201c;ï¿½Quï¿½ pasa, hijita? What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; Amalia&#x2019;s grandmother asked softly, gently hugging her and waiting for an explanation.<br> <br>Amalia shook her head, as she frequently did when she was upset, and her long black hair swept her shoulders. &#x201c;Martha is going away. Her family is moving west, to some weird place in California. So far away from Chicago! Today she had to go straight home to start packing. It&#x2019;s not fair.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That must be difficult.&#x201d; Her grandmother&#x2019;s voice was filled with understanding, and Amalia let out a great sigh.<br> <br>For a while there was silence. The sunlight faded in the kitchen, and as the boiled honey cooled into a dark, thick mass, its sweet aroma filled the air.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shall we knead the melcocha, then?&#x201d; Amalia&#x2019;s grandmother asked as she lifted the old brass pot onto the kitchen table and poured the sticky melcocha into a bowl. The thick white porcelain bowl, with a few chips that spoke of its long use, had a wide yellow rim. Once, the bowl had made Amalia think that it looked like a small sun on the kitchen table. Today she was too upset to see anything but the heavy bowl.<br> <br>They washed their hands thoroughly in the sink and dried them. Her grandmother&#x2019;s kitchen towels each had a day of the week embroidered in a different color. Since today was Friday, the cross-stitched embroidery spelled viernes in azul marino, deep blue. Abuelita had taught Amalia the days of the week and the names of the colors in Spanish using these towels. Although her grandmother never seemed to be teaching, Amalia was frequently surprised when she realized how many things she had learned from Abuelita.<br> <br>After drying their hands, they slathered them with soft butter, which prevented the taffy from sticking to their fingers or burning their skin. Then, with a large wooden spoon, Abuelita scooped some taffy from the bowl and poured it onto their hands.<br> <br>As they pulled and kneaded, the taffy became softer and lighter. They placed little rolls of amber-colored taffy on pieces of waxed paper. Amalia had helped her grandmother pull the melcocha many times, but she never ceased to marvel at how the sweet taffy changed color just from being pulled, kneaded, and pulled again. It transformed from a deep dark brown into a light blond color, just like Martha&#x2019;s hair. Thinking about Martha made Amalia frown.<br> <br>Her grandmother might have seen her expression but made no comment about it. Rather, she said, &#x201c;Wash your hands well, Amalita. Let&#x2019;s sit for a moment while the taffy cools down.&#x201d;<br> <br>Before washing her hands, Amalia licked her fingers. Nothing tasted as good as &#x201c;cleaning up&#x201d; after cooking. The butter and taffy mixed together made a sweet caramel on her fingers, which was every bit as good as the raw cookie dough they &#x201c;cleaned up&#x201d; when she and Martha made cookies at Martha&#x2019;s house.<br> <br>Once Amalia had washed and dried her hands, she followed her grandmother to the living room. They both sat on the floral sofa, which brightened the room as if a piece of the garden had been brought inside the house. Abuelita&#x2019;s fondness for the colors of nature could be seen in each room of her house.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know how hard it is when someone you love goes away. One moment you are angry, then you become sad, and then it seems so unbelievable you almost erase it. Then, when you realize it is true, the anger and the sadness come back all over again, sometimes even more painfully than before. I have gone through that many times.&#x201d;<br> <br>Amalia listened closely, trying to guess who her grandmother was talking about. Was she thinking of her two sons who lived far away or her daughter who always promised to visit from Mexico City but never did? Or was she referring to her husband, Amalia&#x2019;s grandfather, who had died when Amalia was so young that she could not remember him?<br> <br>&#x201c;But one finds ways, Amalia, to keep them close,&#x201d; her grandmother added. And then, smiling as if having just gotten a new idea, she said, &#x201c;Ven. Come with me.&#x201d; She then got up and motioned Amalia to follow her to the dining room.<br> <br>Amalia just wanted to end the conversation. It was bad enough that Martha had told her that she had a surprise and it had turned out to be that Martha was moving to California very soon. Martha&#x2019;s leaving sounded so definite and permanent that she hated even the thought of it. Talking about it only made Amalia feel worse. She wished she did not need to wait for her father to pick her up and could just walk home. Maybe then she could call Martha and hear her say that it all had been a great mistake and they were not moving after all. And it would all disappear like bad dreams do in the morning.</p><h2>Harold Pinter: The Poetics of Silence (A Chicago Classic)</h2><p><br><br><p>This first full-length book on Pinter goes beyond an introductory study to an examination of the isolation characters in his plays endure and the lack of communication they bear.

He was educated at Eton College and later spent a formative period studying languages in Europe. His first job was with Reuters News Agency where a Moscow posting gave him firsthand experience with what would become his literary <i>bete noire</i>&#x2014;the Soviet Union. During World War II he served as Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence and played a key role in Allied espionage operations. <p>After the war he worked as foreign manager of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, a job that allowed him to spend two months each year in Jamaica. Here, in 1952, at his home &#x201c;Goldeneye,&#x201d; he wrote a book called <i>Casino Royale</i>&#x2014;and James Bond was born. The first print run sold out within a month. For the next twelve years Fleming produced a novel a year featuring Special Agent 007, the most famous spy of the century. His travels, interests, and wartime experience lent authority to everything he wrote. Raymond Chandler described him as &#x201c;the most forceful and driving writer of thrillers in England.&#x201d; Sales soared when President Kennedy named the fifth title, <i>From Russia With Love</i>, one of his favorite books. The Bond novels have sold more than one hundred million copies worldwide, boosted by the hugely successful film franchise that began in 1962 with the release of <i>Dr. No</i>. </p><p>He married Anne Rothermere in 1952. His story about a magical car, written in 1961 for their only son Caspar, went on to become the well- loved novel and film <i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</i>. </p><p>Fleming died of heart failure on August 12, 1964, at the age of fifty-six.</p><p><b>1. 'CAN I HELP YOU?'</b></p> <p>The Secret Service holds much that is kept secret even from very senior officers in the organisation. Only M and his Chief of Staff know absolutely everything there is to know. The latter is responsible for keeping the Top Secret record known as 'The War Book' so that, in the event of the death of both of them, the whole story, apart from what is available to individual Sections and Stations, would be available to their successors.</p> <p>One thing that James Bond, for instance, didn't know was the machinery at Headquarters for dealing with the public, whether friendly or otherwise - drunks, lunatics, bona fide applications to join the Service, and enemy agents with plans for penetration or even assassination.</p> <p>On that cold, clear morning in November he was to see the careful cog-wheels in motion.</p> <p>The girl at the switchboard at the Ministry of Defence flicked the switch to 'Hold' and said to her neighbour, 'It's another nut who says he's James Bond. Even knows his code number. Says he wants to speak to M personally.'</p> <p>The senior girl shrugged. The switchboard had had quite a few such calls since, a year before, James Bond's death on a mission to Japan had been announced in the Press. There had even been one pestiferous woman who, at every full moon, passed on messages from Bond from Uranus where it seemed he had got stuck while awaiting entry into heaven. She said, 'Put him through to Liaison, Pat.'</p> <p>The Liaison Section was the first cog in the machine, the first sieve. The operator got back on the line: 'Just a moment, sir. I'll put you on to an officer who may be able to help you.'</p> <p>James Bond, sitting on the edge of his bed, said, 'Thank you.'</p> <p>He had expected some delay before he could establish his identity. He had been warned to expect it by the charming 'Colonel Boris' who had been in charge of him for the past few months after he had finished his treatment in the luxurious Institute on the Nevsky Prospekt in Leningrad. A man's voice came on the line. 'Captain Walker speaking. Can I help you?'</p> <p>James Bond spoke slowly and clearly. 'This is Commander James Bond speaking. Number 007. Would you put me through to M, or his secretary, Miss Moneypenny. I want to make an appointment.'</p> <p>Captain Walker pressed two buttons on the side of his telephone. One of them switched on a tape recorder for the use of his department, the other alerted one of the duty officers in the Action Room of the Special Branch at Scotland Yard that he should listen to the conversation, trace the call, and at once put a tail on the caller. It was now up to Captain Walker, who was in fact an extremely bright ex-prisoner-of-war interrogator from Military Intelligence, to keep the subject talking for as near five minutes as possible. He said, 'I'm afraid I don't know either of these two people. Are you sure you've got the right number?'</p> <p>James Bond patiently repeated the Regent number which was the main outside line for the Secret Service. Together with so much else, he had forgotten it, but Colonel Boris had known it and had made him write it down among the small print on the front page of his forged British passport that said his name was Frank Westmacott, company director.</p> <p>'Yes,' said Captain Walker sympathetically. 'We seem to have got that part of it right. But I'm afraid I can't place these people you want to talk to. Who exactly are they? This Mr Em, for instance. I don't think we've got anyone of that name at the Ministry.'</p> <p>'Do you want me to spell it out? You realise this is an open line?'</p> <p>Captain Walker was rather impressed by the confidence in the speaker's voice. He pressed another button and, so that Bond would hear it, a telephone bell rang. He said, 'Hang on a moment, would you? There's someone on my other line.' Captain Walker got on to the head of his Section. ' Sorry, sir. I've got a chap on who says he's James Bond and wants to talk to M. I know it sounds crazy and I've gone through the usual motions with the Special Branch and so on, but would you mind listening for a minute? Thank you, sir.'</p> <p>Two rooms away a harassed man, who was the Chief Security Officer for the Secret Service, said 'Blast!' and pressed a switch. A microphone on his desk came to life. The Chief Security Officer sat very still. He badly needed a cigarette, but his room was now 'live' to Captain Walker and to the lunatic who called himself 'James Bond'. Captain Walker's voice came over at full strength. 'I'm sorry. Now then. This man Mr Em you want to talk to. I'm sure we needn't worry about security. Could you be more specific?'</p> <p>James Bond frowned. He didn't know that he had frowned and he wouldn't have been able to explain why he had done so. He said, and lowered his voice, again inexplicably, 'Admiral Sir Miles Messervy. He is head of a department in your Ministry. The number of his room used to be twelve on the eighth floor. He used to have a secretary called Miss Moneypenny. Good-looking girl. Brunette. Shall I give you the Chief of Staff's name? No? Well let's see, it's Wednesday. Shall I tell you what'll be the main dish on the menu in the canteen? It should be steak-and-kidney pudding.'</p> <p>The Chief Security Officer picked up the direct telephone to Captain Walker. Captain Walker said to James Bond,' Damn! There's the other telephone again. Shan't be a minute.' He picked up the green telephone. 'Yes, sir?' '</p> <p>I don't like that bit about the steak-and-kidney pudding. Pass him on to the Hard Man. No. Cancel that. Make it the Soft. There was always something odd about 007's death. No body. No solid evidence. And the people on that Japanese island always seemed to me to be playing it pretty close to the chest. The Stone Face act. It's just possible. Keep me informed, would you?'</p> <p>Captain Walker got back to James Bond. 'Sorry about that. It's being a busy day. Now then, this inquiry of yours. Afraid I can't help you myself. Not my part of the Ministry. The man you want is Major Townsend. He should be able to locate this man you want to see. Got a pencil? It's No. 44 Kensington Cloisters. Got that? Kensington double five double five. Give me ten minutes and I'll have a word with him and see if he can help. All right?'</p> <p>James Bond said dully, 'That's very kind of you.' He put down the telephone. He waited exactly ten minutes and picked up the receiver and asked for the number.</p> <p>James Bond was staying at the Ritz Hotel. Colonel Boris had told him to do so. Bond's file in the KGB Archive described him as a high-liver, so, on arrival in London, he must stick to the KGB image of the high life. Bond went down in the lift to the Arlington Street entrance. A man at the news stand got a good profile of him with a buttonhole Minox. When Bond went down the shallow steps to the street and asked the commissionaire for a taxi, a canonflex with a telescopic lens clicked away busily from a Red Roses laundry van at the neighbouring goods entrance and, in due course, the same van followed Bond's taxi while a man inside the van reported briefly to the Action Room of the Special Branch.</p> <p>No. 44 Kensington Cloisters was a dull Victorian mansion in grimy red brick. It had been chosen for its purpose because it had once been the headquarters of the Empire League for Noise Abatement, and its entrance still bore the brass plate of this long-defunct organisation, the empty shell of which had been purchased by the Secret Service through the Commonwealth Relations Office. It also had a spacious old-fashioned basement, re-equipped as detention cells, and a rear exit into a quiet mews. The Red Roses laundry van watched the front door shut behind James Bond and then moved off at a sedate speed to its garage not far from Scotland Yard while the process of developing the canonflex film went on in its interior.</p> <p>'Appointment with Major Townsend,' said Bond.</p> <p>'Yes. He's expecting you, sir. Shall I take your raincoat?' The powerful-looking doorman put the coat on a coathanger and hung it up on one of a row of hooks beside the door. As soon as Bond was safely doseted with Major Townsend, the coat would go swiftly to the laboratory on the first floor where its provenance would be established from an examination of the fabric. Pocket dust would be removed for more leisurely research. 'Would you follow me, sir?'</p> <p>It was a narrow corridor of freshly painted clapboard with a tall, single window which concealed the Fluoroscope triggered automatically from beneath the ugly patterned carpet. The findings of its X-ray eye would be fed into the laboratory above the passage. The passage ended in two facing doors marked 'A' and 'B'. The doorman knocked on Room B and stood aside for Bond to enter.</p> <p>It was a pleasant, very light room, dose-carpeted in dove-grey Wilton. The military prints on the cream walls were expensively framed. A small, bright fire burned under an Adam mantelpiece which bore a number of silver trophies and two photographs in leather frames - one of a nice-looking woman and the other of three nice-looking children. There was a central table with a bowl of flowers and two comfort-able club chain on either side of the fire. No desk or filing cabinets, nothing official-looking. A tall man, as pleasant as the room, got up from the far chair, dropped The Times on the carpet beside it, and came forward with a welcoming smile. He held out a firm, dry hand.</p> <p>This was the Soft Man.</p> <p>'Come in. Come in. Take a pew. Cigarette? Not the ones I seem to remember you favour. Just the good old Senior Service.'</p> <p>Major Townsend had carefully prepared the loaded remark - a reference to Bond's liking for the Morland Specials with the three gold rings. He noted Bond's apparent lack of comprehension. Bond took a cigarette and accepted a light. They sat down facing one another. Major Townsend crossed his legs comfortably. Bond sat up straight Major Townsend said, 'Well now. How can I help you?'</p> <p>Across the corridor, in Room A, a cold Office-of-Works cube with no furnitu...</p></p><h2>Cultivating Development: An Ethnography of Aid Policy and Practice (Anthropology, Culture and Society)</h2><p><p>Development agencies and researchers are preoccupied with policy; with exerting influence over policy, linking research to policy and with implementing policy around the world.<br><br>But what if development practice is not driven by policy? Suppose that the things that make for 'good policy' - policy that legitimises and mobilises political support - in reality make it impossible to implement?<br><br>By focusing in detail on the unfolding activities of a development project in western India over more than ten years, as it falls under different policy regimes, this book takes a close look at the relationship between policy and practice in development. <br><br>David Mosse shows how the actions of development workers are shaped by the exigencies of organisations and the need to maintain relationships rather than by policy; but also that development actors work hardest of all to maintain coherent representations of their actions as instances of authorised policy. Raising unfamiliar questions, Mosse provides a rare self-critical reflection on practice, while refusing to endorse current post-modern dismissal of development.</p></p><p><b>David Mosse</b> is Senior Lecturer in Social Anthropology at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. He is author of The Rule of Water: Statecraft, Ecology and Collective Action in South India (Oxford University Press, 2003).'A superb book, one of those rarities that can change entire ways of thinking. David Mosse is the first social scientist in a generation who can successfuly take cutting-edge insights from academic anthropology and use them to explain practical problems in development. ... For anyone interested in development, "Cultivating Development" is a do-not-miss experience.' --Scott Guggenheim, Lead Social Scientist, The World Bank &nbsp;'[Mosse's provocative thesis challenges the received wisdom of that world and compels us to examine afresh the politics and ethics of engaging with development. Amid the profusion of literature in this field, this book stands apart as an insider's account that is consistently critical yet steadfast in respecting its subjects.

There's a solid chapter on wall and path design and welcome field-guide information on water wildlife, birds, and butterflies. Roth's tone is warm throughout, and she further personalizes the book by including sidebars about other gardeners and their gardens. Grassland, woodland, and freshwater-area ecosystems are covered, although information on coastal or arid areas is absent. For readers in the Southwest, <i>Desert Landscaping</i> would be a better choice. <p> The real shine of <i>Natural Landscaping</i> is in the details on creating a natural habitat that is self-contained and self-perpetuating. For instance, one can plant a butterfly bush to attract butterflies, but what perennial will butterflies lay their eggs in for next year? Instead of fighting a never-ending battle of trapping and killing moles, let these insect-eating creatures tunnel their homes and aerate your soil. Your first impulse may be to tidily clear away fallen wood, but why not position it ornamentally and nourish the soil at the same time? The book is full of this kind of sensible wisdom. It's clear Roth has taken her lessons from Mother Nature seriously. <i>--Karen Karleski</i></p><p><i>Natural Landscaping</i></p><p>Whether you yearn for a colorful meadow garden splashed with asters and black-eyed Susans, a shady garden filled with graceful woodland wildflowers and feathery ferns, or a poolside planting lush with Japanese iris and astilbes, <i>Natural Landscaping</i> can help you make your gardening dreams a landscape reality.

Nothing like this had been seen on this scale since the French Revolution, and before that since the Reformation. Now a different phenomenon seems to be at work: priests who have formed long-time, intimate sexual friendships. These men are not pedophiles or sexual abusers. They are adult, mature men who can no longer find a rationale for a life of obligatory celibacy and enter into responsible sexual relationships. Some of them are straight, some gay. Based on interviews, conducted over a nine-year period, with 50 Australian priests, Priests in Love tells the stories of these priests and their friends. It deals with the moral, psychological, and social challenges they face on the less traveled road of social change.</p></p><p>Jane Anderson received a PhD in anthropology in 2004. Mother of four teenage children, she lives in Yakamia, Western Australia, where she has been active in Catholic parish life for over twenty years.'Although it reads with the ease of a novel, the power of this book is inestimable for furthering a productive dialogue on the sexual issues facing the Catholic Church precisely because it gives voice to real people, real priests, and their companions. These lives challenge any reader to reexamine her or his own life, sexual ideals, and moral compass. After reading it, I decided that it should be dedicated to the Pope and be required reading for every bishop.' -Richard Sipe, author of Celibacy in Crisis: A Secret World Revisited (Richard Sipe)<br><br>&#x201c;No one has captured with greater understanding and insight the personal, human struggles of priests coping with mandated, institutionalized celibacy than Jane Anderson in Priests in Love.

I&#x2019;d snapped wide awake just before dawn, thanks to an experimental add-on I wear on my anterior brain implant. That plug is the one that gives me powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. As far as I know, I&#x2019;m the only person around with two implants.<br>&nbsp;<br>One of these special daddies blasts me into full consciousness at any hour I choose. I&#x2019;ve learned to use it along with another daddy that supercharges my body to remove alcohol and drugs from my system at better than the normal rate. That way I don&#x2019;t wake up still drunk or damaged. Others have suffered in the past because of my hangovers, and I&#x2019;ve sworn never to let that happen again.<br>&nbsp;<br>I took a shower, trimmed my red beard, and dressed in an expensive, sand-colored gallebeya, with the white knit skullcap of my Algerian homeland on my head. I was hungry, and my slave, Kmuzu, normally prepared my meals, but I had a breakfast appointment with Friedlander Bey. That would be after the morning call to prayer, so I had about thirty minutes free. I crossed from the west wing of Friedlander Bey&#x2019;s great house to the east, and rapped on the door to my wife&#x2019;s apartment.<br>&nbsp;<br>Indihar answered it wearing a white satin dressing gown I&#x2019;d given her, her chestnut hair coiled tightly on the back of her head. Indihar&#x2019;s large, dark eyes narrowed. &#x201c;I wish you good morning, husband,&#x201d; she said. She was not terrifically pleased to see me.<br>&nbsp;<br>Indihar&#x2019;s youngest child, four-year-old Hï¿½kim, clung to her and cried. I could hear Jirji and Zahra screaming at each other from another room. Senalda, the Valencian maid I&#x2019;d hired, was nowhere in evidence. I&#x2019;d accepted the responsibility of supporting the family because I felt partly to blame for the death of Indihar&#x2019;s husband. Papa&#x2014;Friedlander Bey&#x2014;had decided that in order to accomplish such a worthy goal without causing gossip, I also had to marry Indihar and formally adopt the three children. I couldn&#x2019;t remember another instance when Papa had cared at all about gossip.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nevertheless, despite Indihar&#x2019;s outrage and my flat refusal, the two of us now found ourselves man and wife. Papa always got his way. Some time ago, Friedlander Bey had grabbed me by the scruff of the neck and shaken the dust off me and turned me from a small-time hustler into a heavy hitter in the city&#x2019;s underworld.<br>&nbsp;<br>So Hï¿½kim was now legally . . . my son, as queasy as that concept made me. I&#x2019;d never been around kids before and I didn&#x2019;t know how to act with them. Believe me, they could tell. I hoisted the boy up and smiled in his jelly-smeared face. &#x201c;Well, why are you crying, O Clever One?&#x201d; I said. Hï¿½kim stopped just long enough to suck in a huge breath, then started wailing even louder.<br>&nbsp;<br>Indihar gave an impatient grunt. &#x201c;Please, husband,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t try being a big brother. Jirji is his big brother.&#x201d; She lifted Hï¿½kim out of my arms and dropped him back to the floor.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not trying to be a big brother.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Then don&#x2019;t try being a pal, either. He doesn&#x2019;t need a pal. He needs a father.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You just tell me what a father does, and I&#x2019;ll do it.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d been trying my best for weeks, but Indihar had only given me a hard time. I was getting very tired of it.<br>&nbsp;<br>She laughed humorlessly and shooed Hï¿½kim toward the rear of the apartment. &#x201c;Is there some actual point to this visit, husband?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Indihar, if you could just stop resenting me a little, maybe we could make the best of this situation. I mean, how awful could it be for you here?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you ask Kmuzu how he feels?&#x201d; she said. She still hadn&#x2019;t invited me into the suite.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;d had enough of standing in the hall, and I pushed by her into the parlor. I sat down on a couch. Indihar glared at me for a few seconds, then sighed and sat on a chair facing me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve explained it all before,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Papa has been giving me things. Gifts I didn&#x2019;t want, like my implants and Chiriga&#x2019;s bar and Kmuzu.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And me,&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, and you. He&#x2019;s trying to strip me of all my friends. He doesn&#x2019;t want me to keep any of my old attachments.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You could simply refuse, husband. Did you ever think of that?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>How I wished it were that easy! &#x201c;When I had my skull amped,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;Friedlander Bey paid the doctors to wire the punishment center of my brain.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The punishment center? Not the pleasure center?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I grinned ruefully. &#x201c;If he&#x2019;d had the pleasure center wired, I&#x2019;d probably already be dead. That&#x2019;s what happens to those wireheads. It wouldn&#x2019;t have taken me long, either.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Indihar frowned. &#x201c;Well, then, I don&#x2019;t understand. Why the punishment center? Why would you want&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I raised a hand and cut her off. &#x201c;Hey, I didn&#x2019;t want it! Papa had it done without my knowledge. He&#x2019;s got lots of little electronic gimmicks that can remotely stimulate my pain centers. That&#x2019;s how he keeps me in line.&#x201d; Learning recently that he was truly my mother&#x2019;s grandfather had not disposed me more favorably toward him. Not as long as he refused to discuss the matter of my liberty.<br>&nbsp;<br>I saw her shudder. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know that, husband.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t told many people about it. But Papa&#x2019;s always there looking over my shoulder, ready to jam his thumb on the agony button if I do something he doesn&#x2019;t like.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re a prisoner, too,&#x201d; said Indihar. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re his slave, as much as the rest of us.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I didn&#x2019;t see any need to reply. The situation was a trifle different in my case, because I shared Friedlander Bey&#x2019;s blood, and I felt obliged to try to love him. I hadn&#x2019;t actually succeeded in that yet. I had a difficult time dealing with that emotion in the first place, and Papa wasn&#x2019;t making it easy for me.<br>&nbsp;<br>Indihar reached out her hand to me, and I took it. It was the first time since we&#x2019;d been married that she&#x2019;d relented any at all. I saw that her palm and fingers were still stained a faint yellow-orange, from the henna her friends had applied the morning of our wedding. It had been a very unusual ceremony, because Papa had declared that it wouldn&#x2019;t be appropriate for me to marry anyone but a maiden. Indihar was, of course, a widow with three children, so he had her declared an honorary virgin. Nobody laughed.<br>&nbsp;<br>The wedding itself was a mixture of customs observed in the city as well as those from Indihar&#x2019;s native Egyptian village. It pretended to be the joining of a young virgin and a Maghrebi youth of promising fortune. Friedlander Bey announced that it wasn&#x2019;t necessary to fetch Indihar&#x2019;s family to the celebration, that her friends from the Budayeen could stand in for them.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll pass over the ritual certification, of course,&#x201d; Indihar had said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; I asked. I was afraid that at the last minute, I was going to be required to take some kind of written test that I should&#x2019;ve been studying for ever since puberty.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;In some backward Muslim lands,&#x201d; explained Friedlander Bey, &#x201c;on the wedding night, the bride is taken into a bedroom, away from all the other guests. The women of both families hold her down on the bed. The husband wraps a white cloth around his forefinger, and inserts it to prove the girl&#x2019;s virginity. If the cloth comes out stained with blood, the husband passes it out to the bride&#x2019;s father, who then marches around waving it on a stick for all to see.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But this is the seventeenth century of the Hegira!&#x201d; I said, astonished.<br>&nbsp;<br>Indihar shrugged. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a moment of great pride for the bride&#x2019;s parents. It proves they&#x2019;ve raised a chaste and worthy daughter. When I was first married, I wept at the indignity until I heard the cheers and joy of the guests. Then I knew that my marriage had been blessed, and that I&#x2019;d become a woman in the eyes of the village.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;As you say, my daughter,&#x201d; said Friedlander Bey, &#x201c;in this instance such a certification will not be required.&#x201d; Papa could be reasonable if he didn&#x2019;t stand to lose anything by it.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;d bought Indihar a fine gold wedding band, as well as the traditional second piece of jewelry. Chiri, my not-so-silent partner, helped me select the gift in one of the expensive boutiques east of the Boulevard il-Jameel, where the Europeans shopped. It was a brooch, an emerald-encrusted lizard made of gold, with two rubies for eyes. It had cost me twelve thousand kiam, and it was the most expensive single item I&#x2019;d ever purchased. I gave it to Indihar the morning of the wedding. She opened the satin-lined box, looked at the emerald lizard for a few seconds, and then said, &#x201c;Thank you, Marï¿½d.&#x201d; She never mentioned it again, and I never saw her wear it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Indihar had not been well-off, even before her husband was killed. She brought to our marriage only a modest assortment of household furnishings and her meager personal belongings. Her contribution wasn&#x2019;t materially important, because I&#x2019;d become wealthy through my association with Papa. In fact, the amount specified as her bride-pri...</p><h2>Diane Arbus: A Biography</h2><p>Diane Arbus&#39;s startling photographic images of dwarfs, twins, transvestites, and freaks seemed from the first to redefine both the normal and the abnormal in our lives; they were already becoming part of the iconography of the age when Arbus committed suicide in 1971. Arbus herself remained an enigma until the publication of this first full biography. Patricia Bosworth examines the life behind the eerie, mesmerizing photographs: Diane&#39;s pampered childhood; her passionate marriage to Allan Arbus and their work together as fashion photographers during the fifties; the emotional upheaval surrounding the end of that marriage; and the radically dark, liberating, and ultimately tragic turn Diane&#39;s art took during the sixties. Bosworth&#39;s engrossing book is a compassionate portrait of the woman behind some of the most powerful photographs of our time.</p><p>Opportunities for sensationalism abound in a book about Arbus, who already had a history of severe depressions and a crumbling marriage by the time she began to take the controversial, technically innovative pictures of dwarfs, nudists and drag queens that won her a reputation as &#34;a photographer of freaks.&#34; Bosworth balances the lurid details -- rumors that Arbus had sex with her subjects, that she photographed her own suicide in 1971 -- with a nuanced appraisal of an artist whose images captured the uneasy mood of the 1960s by expressing her personal obsessions.Patricia Bosworth is the author of biographies of Montgomery Clift and Marlon Brando. She is a contributing editor of Vanity Fair and has taught writing at Columbia University. She lives in New York.</p><h2>The Sheriff of Nottingham</h2><p>Has there ever been a less lovable character in folk literature than that craven creature, the nameless Sheriff of Nottingham?<br><br> He remains to this day, fed byHollywood versions of the legend, the hateful, impotent foil to thatcelebrated bowman, Robin Hood.&nbsp; Now, with his novel, <i>The Sheriff of Nottingham</i>, Richard Kluger turns the timeless tale on its head in a vivid,compassionate narrative based upon authentic and quite startlinghistory.<br><br> Through a fusion of art and documentedfact, Kluger portrays a far different sheriff.&nbsp; Philip Mark, a soldierof fortune from Touraine in the heart of&nbsp; France and actually cited byname in the text of the Magna Carta as objectionable to the king'sbarons, is a complex figure, a man with a heart, a conscience, and deftpolitical instincts.&nbsp; Posted to Nottinghamshire in 1208 as the crown'schief law officer, he is answerable only to King John himself, a monarch who has been handed down to posterity - perhaps not altogether fairly - as an unredeemed tyrant presiding over a tumultuous age.<br><br> In vital, dramatic colors, Klugerpaints a panorama of that England at the dawn of modernity and itsprincipal players and events.&nbsp; Here are dark intrigue and adroitstatecraft, hand-to-hand combat and sharp wits in collision, anavaricious ruler&nbsp; attempting to seduce his sheriff's wife on Christmasnight, and the hatching of the Magna Carta itself at Nottingham Castleone fine September eve in 1213 (along with the reasons why Philip Markis specifically mentioned in that immortal document).<br><br> Storytelling at its most gripping comes in the novel's powerfully moving centerpiece.&nbsp; Thirty sons of Welshwarlords are consigned to Philip's castle as royal hostages on theorders of the king to ensure that their volatile fathers behavethemselves back in chronically rebellious Wales.&nbsp; The boys are treatedwith respect and kindness by the sheriff and his family until a yearlater when King John thunders into the castle courtyard at the head ofhis entourage and, in a fury over a new Welsh uprising, roars at Philip, "Hang the hostages - hang them all - and at once!"&nbsp; How Sheriff Markresponds to this grim command forms the moral core of the novel.<br><br> In <i>The Sheriff of Nottingham</i>, Kluger has woven an engrossing medieval tapestry that transports thereader beyond the mists of time and legend to witness the struggle of asingular character seeking to act honorably in a time ruled by savageimpulse and civil uproar.</p><p>Richard Kluger is an American author who, after working as a New Yorkjournalist and publishing executive, turned in mid-career to writingwidely lauded books on U.S. social history.&nbsp; His two best known worksare <i>Simple Justice</i>, generally regarded as thedefinitive account of the U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 landmark decisionoutlawing racially segregated public schools, and <i>Ashes to Ashes</i>, a critical history of the cigarette industry and its lethal toll on the public's health, which won the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction in 1997.Taking full advantage of the poetic license that fiction affords, award-winning social-historian Kluger returns with a sixth novel (Un-American Activities, 1982, etc.), painting the popular legend of Robin Hood and his nemesis in an intriguing, entirely different light. Sheriff Philip Mark shines forth from the outset as a veritable paragon of virtue, arriving at Nottingham Castle in 1208 with his family to take up his position as a reward for battlefield service rendered to King John in France. In contrast to the pilferers and scoundrels who preceded him, and in spite of the inclinations of nearly all who serve him, Philip quickly establishes his tenure as a model of propriety and decency, in which his loyalty to the King can never be doubted. Aided primarily by Sparks, his faithful, keen-witted adviser whom he raises from castle obscurity, and his eminently practical wife Anne, who advances his cause in her own way--satisfying her needs in the bargain--the Sheriff gains general respect and no small amount of enmity from those over whom he gains the upper hand. His oath of obedience is sorely tried at times, never more than when called upon by his enraged King to hang a group of well-born Welsh lads held hostage in the castle, but he remains true to the end, hoping for but never receiving knighthood as his just due. In his tenacious struggle to retain honor and dignity the Merry Men in Sherwood Forest play a minor, largely comic role, while the broader historical pageant involving the King, the Church, and conditions leading to the Magna Carta receives full consideration. Vivid though the pageantry is, the Sheriff himself is too noble for his own good; his ethics prove predictable and tedious, and spoil an otherwise impressive saga. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In the 1930s, while the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression sent most of America into the doldrums, a lively intellectual and artistic community formed in the West, revolving around three legendary friends: Ed Ricketts, John Steinbeck, and Joseph Campbell. Steinbeck immortalized Monterey's bohemian spirit in Cannery Row, but the area's true lifeblood was his best friend and mentor, Ed Ricketts. Today he's usually remembered as "Doc" &#x2014; the beer-drinking philosopher-scientist who presides over Monterey's population of "whores, pimps, gamblers, and sons of bitches" in Cannery Row &#x2014; but Ricketts was actually a highly accomplished ecologist who did seminal work in the emerging field of marine biology. His two books, Between Pacific Tides and Sea of Cortez (coauthored with Steinbeck), are still considered classics.</p><p>Eric Enno Tamm holds an MA in print journalism from USC and has written for numerous publications, including Wallpaper* and the Globe and Mail. He works at a conservation group based in Vancouver, Canada.It's quite likely that even the most enthusiastic readers of <i>Cannery Row</i> don't know much about Ed Ricketts, the self-taught marine biologist depicted in John Steinbeck's novel as "Doc"&#x2014;a beer-guzzling bohemian science-philosopher presiding genially over the coastal California town's seedy sardine-packing population of "whores, pimps, gamblers, and sons of bitches." Tamm's account of Ricketts's short life (he died in 1948, at age 51, killed while crossing train tracks) is an engrossing memoir. Freelance writer Tamm smartly weaves in-depth literary analysis of Steinbeck's fiction into his narrative, though writing relatively little about mythologist Joseph Campbell's spiritual explorations. But the links drawn among the three friends (though Steinbeck and Campbell soon had a lifelong falling out around marital infidelity) provide a fascinating insight into how art, science and philosophy can nurture, inspire and feed off one another. Tamm writes with impassioned honesty about his subject's many dimensions. Ricketts was a beach bum, philanderer and party-hearty hedonist, but he was also an intuitive ecologist, whose early warnings about sardine over-fishing along the California and Alaskan coasts in the 1930s proved prescient; an environmental visionary, whose dire observations about the impact of industrial effluvia on shoreline habitats in the 1940s went unheeded; and a true renaissance man, whose avant-garde fusion of life and science inspired the lives he touched. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But in more recent times, its illustrious reputation was often overlooked and this once beloved beverage fell out of favour. Now, with sherry undergoing a renaissance and becoming a star ingredient on the craft cocktail scene, that is all about to change. Part travelogue, part recipe book, Sherry is an essential read for wine professionals and drink enthusiasts alike. Beginning with an overview of the different types of sherry and how they are made, it moves on to tell the story of this complex wine through the people and places that produce it, as well as the mouth-watering dishes that best complement it - from Seafood Tortillitas to Braised Chicken and Clams Sofrito. An entire chapter of 43 sherry-based cocktails - plus a buyer&#39;s guide listing the top producers and the best wines - launches this traditional wine firmly into the present day and will make even the sherry novice an expert on this versatile drink. From its extraordinary history to its modern day use, Talia Baiocchi has created an exceptional guide through the whole spectrum of sherry.</p><p>TALIA BAIOCCHI is the editor-in-chief of <i>PUNCH</i>, an online magazine focused on wine, spirits, and cocktails. Previously, Baiocchi was the wine editor for <i>Eater </i>and a columnist at <i>Wine Spectator. </i>She has written for the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, <i>Decanter</i>, <i>Bon Appï¿½tit</i>, and <i>Wine &amp; Spirits </i>magazine, among others. In 2013, she was named a top new talent in the food and wine world in <i>Forbes </i>magazine&#x2019;s &#x201c;30 Under 30&#x201d; feature. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.As my train pulled into the station in sherry&#x2019;s historic capital, Jerez de la Frontera, rain spattered against my window and onto the platform below. I was half-awake, with a mosaic of half-eaten <i>jamï¿½n bocadillo</i> stuck to the front of my sweater, classically overpacked yet without an umbrella in January, a month so rainy it makes you forget that arid Morocco is anywhere near Jerez.<br><br> I shuffled into the lavishly tiled station bleary-eyed and inelegant. In such a state only a few things were immediately clear to me. I was in Spain. Spanish was being spoken. To my right, in the train station cafï¿½: the hum of the espresso machine, the faint mumble of a football game, and the clink of cups meeting saucers&#x2014;a definably Spanish kind of clink and hum.&nbsp;Furthermore, I was in southern Spain. Nobody was in a hurry. In fact, people almost looked embarrassed to be making their trains. (And, let me tell you this now, because it&#x2019;s as true as anything I&#x2019;ve learned while writing this book: never, ever come to this part of Spain and show up to a meeting on time. You will startle and confuse your host.)<br><br> I tumbled out onto the street and into a cab, cracked the window, and watched the buildings whirl by, whitewash peeling off their faï¿½ades to reveal the scars of centuries. Seville orange trees lined the sidewalks, sagging with fruit so fragrant it smelled as if the streets were paved with marmalade. I was a goner, of course, but it&#x2019;s not hard to fall in love with the aesthetic beauty of this place and the obvious cultural bounty&#x2014;the sherry, the food, the music, the everything&#x2014;that has enchanted centuries&#x2019; worth of thinkers, poets, explorers, artists, and <br> (apparently) California girls. But Federico Garcï¿½a Lorca&#x2014;the great early twentieth-century Spanish poet often dubbed the Son of Andalusia&#x2014;would say to look past the obvious charms, that the real Andalusia cannot be seen.<br><br> It&#x2019;s true that the cultural affluence smells and tastes so good that it&#x2019;s easy to forget the centuries of conflict buried underneath Jerez, Sanlï¿½car de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa Marï¿½a&#x2014;both literally and figuratively. These three towns, which form the roughly 25,000-acre swath known as the <i>marco de Jerez,</i> or Sherry Triangle, have seen a tremendous amount of historical tumult and variety of cultural influence. In many ways, sherry&#x2014;in its idiosyncrasies, triumphs, and failures&#x2014;is an embodiment of the region&#x2019;s experience.<br><br> It is a wine that has endured through thousands of years of political upheaval, sacking, conquest, and economic disappointment. But sherry&#x2019;s highs have certainly outweighed its lows: it was practically the official drink of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century explorers; a favorite of everyone from Shakespeare to Poe to Dickens; the base of the Sherry Cobbler, one of the greatest American cocktails ever invented; and, believe it or not, one of the muses of California&#x2019;s nascent wine-producing industry before it set its sights on Bordeaux as a model. So it&#x2019;s not hyperbole when I say that sherry&#x2019;s story is one of the most remarkable in the history of wine.<br><br> Despite its storied pedigree, however, sherry has been maligned in America for decades&#x2014;so misunderstood that one wonders whether it was the victim of an elaborate smear campaign involving all of the grandmas, everywhere. But against odds that seemed insurmountable just ten years ago, sherry&#x2014;real sherry, not the warm, blended stuff still found lurking in octogenarian pantries&#x2014;is undergoing a renaissance. It has become a star ingredient on the modern craft cocktail scene, beloved of bartenders who use it in pre-Prohibition-era cocktails as well as in their own contemporary drinks. It is popping up on wine lists in restaurants and bars from New York to New Orleans to San Francisco, where sommeliers have finally given sherry the real estate it deserves. And at long last, importers and wine shops are selling an unprecedented array of sherries from producers large and small, which means that the best sherry wines are available to American consumers for the first time in generations.<br> Sherry has, in short, been reborn. And with this rebirth, it&#x2019;s time that sherry&#x2019;s story is retold.<br><br> In simple terms, sherry is a wine produced in Jerez de la Frontera, Sanlï¿½car de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa Marï¿½a. It is a fortified wine, which means that a small amount of neutral grape spirit (brandy) is added to the wine to increase its alcohol content. Fortification&#x2014;or, more specifically, the lingering negative connotations surrounding it (thanks, Thunderbird)&#x2014;is one of the reasons sherry is so misunderstood in America. Another reason: its wide range of styles, which include both the driest and the sweetest wines in the world, and numerous points in between.<br><br> There are four dry styles of sherry, each with differing modes of production: <br> fino (in which style I include manzanilla, which though distinct in character is simply a fino aged in the town of Sanlï¿½car de Barrameda), amontillado, palo cortado, and oloroso. These styles fit, in this order, along a spectrum from lightest to fullest.<br> In addition to the range of dry wines, the region produces two naturally sweet wines: pedro ximï¿½nez (known affectionately as &#x201c;PX&#x201d;) and moscatel.<br><br> And those cheap, sweet bottles with the sticky labels left marinating in pantries across America? Those fit into the category of blended sherries, which are generally made by mixing one of the dry styles with either PX, moscatel, or unfermented grape must and labeled with designations like &#x201c;pale cream,&#x201d; &#x201c;cream,&#x201d; &#x201c;amoroso,&#x201d; and &#x201c;medium.&#x201d;<br><br> In America, people often equate sherry with these ubiquitous, sweetened wines. Thus, the entire category is generally considered sweet, even though the majority of it is not. That fact, coupled with a general distrust of fortified wines, has long kept sherry from the dinner table. But sherry is above all a wine, and one that should be consumed like any other wine: with food. In fact, the intense savoriness of the dry wines and their compatibility with a wide range of cuisines, from English pub fare to sushi, are what&#x2019;s helped drive modern interest in it.<br> But while sherry should be considered a wine like any other, it&#x2019;s also true that its production methods, especially, make it unique within the world of wine&#x2014;and not in an academic or abstract way. The differences are dramatic, and visceral.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;No wine differs so much from all others, and the differences are not merely of taste or colour, of scent or sparkle, but of kind . . . it is not a variant, but a primary,&#x201d; writes Rupert Croft-Cooke in his 1956 book, <i>Sherry</i>. &#x201c;There is Sherry, and there are all other wines.&#x201d;<br><br> Despite what all the vowels in my name might imply, I was not reared on the great wines of Italy and my mother, who is half Spanish, did not teach me either the art of flamenco or how to love fino sherry.<br><br> Instead, it all begins with a stoned surfer, a liquor store on Pacific Coast Highway, a carful of high school girls, and a botched request for Bailey&#x2019;s. That night I had my first taste of Harvey&#x2019;s Bristol Cream Sherry, which I stirred into a concoction that I still maintain is the worst blended drink I&#x2019;ve ever consumed. <br><br> I was sixteen.<br><br> Five years later (and no thanks to the Bristol Cream), I broke the news to my parents that I&#x2019;d fallen in love with wine. Instead of going to law school as predicted (or at least as hoped), I&#x2019;d taken a job as a vineyard slave in Piedmont, Italy, and I wouldn&#x2019;t be back until I&#x2019;d spent all of the money my relatives sent for graduation. (P.S. I love you.)<br><br> I had my second sip of sherry the year after I returned from Italy, when I wandered into Bar Jamï¿½n, a pocket square of a restaurant on Irving Place in New York&#x2019;s Gramercy neighborhood, just down the block from the wine store where I worked. I went for the ham, but I left loving sherry. That night the bartender poured me the first <i>real</i> sherry I&#x2019;d ever tasted: a chilled <i>copita</i> of oloroso. It was both incredibly foreign and totally familiar&#x2014;like old Barolo laced with iodine that was amplified, reduced, and somehow elegant despite its heft. It sparked that dull, joyous pulse in the gut that travels north, gains momentum in the chest, and releases all its pent-up energy behind the eyes in the same way that good &#x2019;90s rock choruses, eggs with truffles on them, love, Barolo, and log rides do. It&#x2019;s a variety of bliss, I guess; the kind that is best expressed through tears or dancing&#x2014;or, if you&#x2019;ve had enough sherry, both.<br> That was in 2007, and sherry was at the tail end of a decades-long decline that had left it nearly irrelevant&#x2014;a wine best reserved for bridge games and bad jokes. In fact, the best bit of PR the wines enjoyed over the last thirty years was a nine-year stint on the sitcom <i>Frasier</i> as the object of the Crane brothers&#x2019; alcoholic affection, which doubled as a backhanded jab at their stodgy Britishness. In a testament to how old-fashioned it had become, the Cranes served their sherry warm out of a decanter next to Frasier&#x2019;s grand piano, and sipped it pinky up.<br><br> But just a few years after <i>Frasier&#x2019;s</i> run ended, rumblings of an unlikely renaissance began in the cocktail world. The modern-day craft cocktail revival inspired bartenders and consumers alike to rediscover America&#x2019;s pre-Prohibition-era drinking past. Bars around the country were studiously unearthing nineteenth-century recipes, many of which called for sherry as a primary ingredient. The rebirth of classic cocktails like the Sherry Cobbler gave sherry a way back into the barman&#x2019;s repertoire. By 2009, sherry had become a budding trend in the cocktail world, with bars from coast to coast featuring sherry prominently on their menus.<br><br> The wine world wasn&#x2019;t far behind. The improved distribution of smaller, high-quality sherry bottlings&#x2014;including Lustau&#x2019;s Almacenista line, the boutique sherries of El Maestro Sierra, Hidalgo&#x2013;La Gitana&#x2019;s Manzanilla Pasada Pastrana, and Emilio Hidalgo&#x2019;s La Panesa, as well as the La Bota wines from Equipo Navazos&#x2014;helped hook the more progressive sommelier set. Within a few years New York and San Francisco had become incubators for an overdue American fascination with one of the first wines ever imported to the New World. Sherry, quite suddenly, was hip.<br><br> Some of this comeback is linked to a decades-long shift in flavor hierarchy in the American palate&#x2014;a slow but steady decrease in the dominance of fruit flavors to an embrace of bitter and intensely savory flavors. Simply browse the greens section at Whole Foods: endive, treviso, arugula, and dandelion greens now hold court in aisles that once pledged allegiance to Bibb lettuce and spinach. Even McDonald&#x2019;s serves radicchio now. As it applies to beverages, this change can help us understand everything from the rise of the bitter, Campari-based Negroni cocktail to the unlikely popularity of intensely savory skin-fermented orange wines.<br><br> Enter sherry. Its various dry styles&#x2014;fino and manzanilla, amontillado, palo cortado, and oloroso&#x2014;are arguments for rebellion against fruit: wine&#x2019;s anthems about the savory. They are also wines that deserve to be on the table. And that is the great lesson we are learning in America: while sherry&#x2019;s production process makes it unique within the world of wine, it represents more of a convergence with table wine than a departure. And the more I taste, the more I find glimpses of other wines&#x2014;the salinity of Chablis, the warmth and meatiness of northern Rhï¿½ne Syrah, the earthiness and florality of Nebbiolo&#x2014;in the wines of the Sherry Triangle.<br><br> It&#x2019;s thanks to some of the country&#x2019;s best sommeliers and bartenders that sherry is finally being understood as both a table wine and an element that can make a cocktail more complex. These are people like Ashley Santoro, the former wine director of Manhattan&#x2019;s Casa Mono and Bar Jamï¿½n, who would be a millionaire if she had a buck for every time she&#x2019;s heard &#x201c;I thought that was for grandmas&#x201d; during her years at the restaurant. She converted many of those people by slipping glasses of fino or manzanilla next to countless plates of <i>ibï¿½rico</i> ham, gratis. There&#x2019;s Sean Diggins, formerly of Gitane, who was pouring more than twenty sherries by the glass before most restaurants in San Francisco even thought to consider it. And Sandro Piliego, an Italian from Lazio who fell in love with sherry in the late 1990s, when collecting it was about as cool as collecting navel fuzz. When I asked him why an Italian guy would move to America to open a Spanish restaurant in Brooklyn, he said, plainly, &#x201c;For the love of sherry.&#x201d;<br> There are dozens of people who helped dig sherry out of the dark ages and have pushed to prove that the wines of Jerez de la Frontera, Sanlï¿½car de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa Marï¿½a, as well as those of Montilla-Moriles, are some of the world&#x2019;s most intriguing and uniquely <i>terroir</i>-driven food wines. They are different, yes, but they require nothing but curiosity (and perhaps a little <i>jamï¿½n</i>).<br><br> In fact, thirteen years after that not-so-fateful night on PCH and more than three years after that first rainy January in Jerez, I&#x2019;ve realized that unbridled curiosity&#x2014;not knowledge, or fancy glassware, or the right vernacular&#x2014;is the only thing you need to love wine. It&#x2019;s the one thing that led me here, and perhaps it&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s led you here, too.</p><h2>The E-Word: Ego, Enlightenment &amp; Other Essentials</h2><p>"An excellent and entertaining look at the issues, challenges, and resolutions that come with the territory of awakening.&#x201d; &#x2014;Gary Renard, bestselling author of The Disappearance of the Universe trilogy<br><br>A book of liberation and ecstasy, <i>The E-Word </i>lucidly explains how the ego is created, how it thinks, and how its limited mind-set can be expanded&#x2014;not inflated&#x2014;into a joyous transpersonal perspective that eradicates feelings of isolation, fear, and insecurity in your life.<br> <br>Through stories, practices, and a masterful detangling of Maslow&#x2019;s hierarchy of needs,<i> </i>the Matrix, and quantum physics,<i> The E-Word</i> strips the ego bare and liberates the soul in highly entertaining, relatable ways, revealing how even self-improvement techniques can chase away the very fulfillment and wisdom we seek.

For now.The E-Word 1<p></p> QUESTIONS<p></p> <br>How can we be here and not wonder at the miracle of existence?<br> <br>It all started when my dog ran away.<br> <br>Actually, it started a lot earlier than that.<br> <br>Like most kids, I asked a ton of questions growing up. &#x201c;Why is the sky blue? Why do I have to go to school? Why can&#x2019;t I eat ice cream for dinner?&#x201d; And answers to questions like that were reliably forthcoming.<br> <br>But answers to the really interesting questions like, &#x201c;Who am I? Why am I here? What is life? What is God? What is death?&#x201d; went unanswered. I was told there were no answers to such questions, so it was best not to ask.<br> <br>Which shut me up temporarily.<br> <br>But the questions never went away. As I went about living a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; life I just lost track of them for a while.<br> <br>I went to school, got a degree, developed a great career in the (at that time) exclusively male bastion of network sports television, got a dog, made money, got married, bought a house with a swimming pool, and then got divorced and sold the house with the swimming pool.<br> <br>It was the move from the big house with the big yard in suburbia that did it. What large, self-respecting, half collie, half German shepherd would tolerate a small midtown Atlanta apartment? Apparently not my dog, Merlin. After screaming myself hoarse and plastering his picture on every telephone pole in a two-mile downtown radius, in desperation I finally took a friend&#x2019;s advice and went to see a psychic.<br> <br>A rather plump, matronly woman named Virginia assured me Merlin was okay. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s all part of the plan, dear,&#x201d; she said soothingly. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. He&#x2019;ll be back in&#x201d;&#x2014;she closed her eyes briefly&#x2014;&#x201c;eleven more days. Now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. let&#x2019;s talk about you.&#x201d;<br> <br>What about me?<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t care.<br> <br>But she wouldn&#x2019;t back off. As often as I tried to lead the conversation back to my dog, she kept bringing it back to me. Apparently I was not doing what I&#x2019;d come to planet Earth to do. I was fiddling while Rome burned. I needed to clean up my act. I needed to quit smoking and get a handle on the booze. I needed to exercise. I needed to move back to the country (I&#x2019;d been raised on a farm). I needed to get in touch with my Higher Self.<br> <br>I needed to meditate.<br> <br>Really?<br> <br>I paid and left feeling unsettled. I was relieved to hear Merlin would come back. Not that I totally believed it. But the rest? What a load of hooey. And then, after lots more driving around town calling his name, crying, and poster plastering, exactly eleven days later, Merlin came home.<br> <br>Hmm&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how the hell did she know?<br> <br>THAT SIMPLE QUESTION OPENED the floodgates. If she&#x2019;d been right about my dog, what about the rest of what she&#x2019;d said? It wasn&#x2019;t like I was actually happy or anything. Network sports television, while exciting and lucrative, was also stressful and exhausting. I hated living in the city. And drinking and smoking, both of which I did a lot, made me feel like crap.<br> <br>Why not make a change?<br> <br>Within a month I&#x2019;d found a great condo on the Chattahoochee River next door to a state park north of the city. I bought a kayak and started paddling the river. I hiked with Merlin. I danced. I quit smoking and dropped the hard liquor, diving into an exploration of fine wines instead.<br> <br>And I started meditating.<br> <br>Why not?<br> <br>All I had to do was close my eyes, put my hands in a funny position, and look within. I mean, how hard could it be?<br> <br>Right.<br> <br>OKAY. I GOT IT. A crazy person was at the helm.<br> <br>A crazy person with a mind that contradicted itself and never shut up and yet had nothing interesting to say. A crazy person who was restless and couldn&#x2019;t sit still, who felt anxious and nervous over nothing, whose brain couldn&#x2019;t hold a coherent thought for more than fifteen seconds.<br> <br>And why bother trying? My most profound thoughts revolved around sex, food, money, and the latest sitcom plot. What was there to hold on to?<br> <br>So much for self-discovery.<br> <br>But I persevered. After all, there had to be something in there&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>And so every night I sat up in bed and looked within for hours (if I could stay awake) watching the yadda yadda in my brain that was, apparently, the sum total of &#x201c;me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Talk about depressing. But then, after about six months, something extraordinary happened.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d drifted off to sleep sitting bolt upright (as usual), when suddenly, I was aware of a bright light and high ringing tone all around me. The light got brighter until it was LIGHT. The ringing got louder. The most awesome ocean of LOVE swept through me. I became aware that the light was actually a being.<br> <br>I woke up, scrabbling around in my blankets trying to get on my knees to bow down to this being. And yet the light still filled my mind and I could still feel the love and hear the ringing. So I cried out to the being, &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>And the most enormous, gentle tide of laughter rolled through me&#x2014;laughter that was infinitely loving and very familiar. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll know someday,&#x201d; came the answer. Not in words. And yet the understanding was crystal clear in my mind.<br> <br>Then gradually the light and the ringing presence and the love died away.

Collectively known as the Third Battle of Ypres, the fighting raged from early June until mid-November, and revealed new depths of tragedy, heights of gallantry, astonishing stoicism, humour, loss, grief, and terrible human suffering. The remains of no less than 200,000 soldiers still lie unfound within the narrow boundaries of the battlefield of Passchendaele. The German panoramas - many of which have not seen the light of day since the end of the war - match and often surpass the Imperial War Museum for both scale and quality. Like their British equivalents, they were taken at huge personal risk by specialist photographers. All the panoramas reveal what no other photographs can - the view beyond the trench parapet - and a great deal more. Also included are unpublished testimony, letters and memoirs from all the different regiments who served on the Somme, sourced from the regimental archives across the United Kingdom, Ireland and elsewhere; stunning mapping, plans and diagrams throughout; and equivalent aerial photographs.</p></p><p>Peter Barton is a historian and film-maker.

Valeria Finucci shows how ideas of masculinity were formed in the midst of acute anxiety about paternity by highlighting the beliefs&#x2014;widely held at the time&#x2014;that conception could occur without a paternal imprimatur or through a woman&#x2019;s encounter with an animal, or even that a pregnant woman&#x2019;s imagination could erase the father&#x2019;s "signature" from the fetus. Against these visions of reproduction gone awry, Finucci looks at how concepts of masculinity were tied to issues of paternity through social standing, legal matters, and inheritance practices.<p></p><p>Highlighting the fissures running through Italian Renaissance ideas of manliness, Finucci describes how, alongside pervasive images of the virile, sexually active man, early modern Italian culture recognized the existence of hermaphrodites and started to experiment with a new kind of sexuality by manufacturing a non-man: the castrato. Following the creation of<i> </i>castrati, the Church forbade the marriage of all non-procreative men, and, in this move, Finucci identifies a powerful legitimation of the view that what makes men is not the possession of male organs or the ability to have sex, but the capability to father. Through analysis, anecdote, and rich cultural description, <i>The Manly Masquerade</i> exposes the "real" early modern man: the paterfamilias.</p><p></p></p><p>&#34;Valeria Finucci&#39;s book questions the traditional concepts associated with the Italian Renaissance (harmony, spiritual perfection and beauty, etc.) and addresses much less &#39;luminous&#39; aspects of sixteenth-century Italian culture.&#34;--Armando Maggi, author of &#34;Satan&#39;s Rhetoric: A Study of Renaissance Demonology&#34;<p>Valeria Finucci is Associate Professor of Italian at Duke University.

To share one last smile, a final kiss.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ll never see him again.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s been three hours since I held Jack in my arms and I&#x2019;ll never hear his voice again, the way he laughed freely, the way he said my name, Remy, whispered like a prayer in the dark.<br> <br>Three hours since strangers pulled me away from his body, and I&#x2019;ll never run my fingers through his dark hair, never feel the heat of his touch against my skin.<br> <br>Three hours since Elise pointed a gun at him, and I&#x2019;ll never taste his kiss again, breathe in the scent of his peppermint shampoo.<br> <br>&#x201c;We need to come up with a story,&#x201d; my parents tell me. Something to give the police, something to explain what happened, what I was doing there.<br> <br>They want me to lie but they won&#x2019;t say that word, they won&#x2019;t say lie. My parents, they want to protect me. I can see the fear in their eyes. They fear for me, what might happen to me. But there&#x2019;s something else too, a different kind of fear.<br> <br>They&#x2019;re not just afraid for me, they&#x2019;re afraid of me.<br> <br>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½<br> <br>Here is the truth.<br> <br>I was born Katherine Remy Tsai, but everyone calls me Remy. I used to know how my story would turn out, but now I have no idea what tomorrow will look like. I used to know what laughter felt like, but now I can&#x2019;t imagine smiling ever again.<br> <br>I live in the north suburbs of Atlanta, in a town called Lyndens Creek. There is no creek, though, none I&#x2019;ve ever heard of, and I was born here. It used to be farmland, just hills and animals. Now it&#x2019;s a nice town, with nice people, the kind who could never, ever fire six bullets into someone&#x2019;s chest.<br> <br>There are nice schools here, and we went to one of them, Riverside High, known for its terrible football team and soaring SAT scores. The kind of school funded by sprawling golf-course communities where retired lawyers and men of business putter around, and where I fell in love with Jack under a blanket of stars.<br> <br>Yes. This is a nice place, and I used to be someone who belonged here.<br> <br>In my bathroom now, I look into the mirror to find a stranger staring back at me. Steam from the running water consumes the bathroom until the glass fogs over and I am suffocating.<br> <br>The clothes I was wearing only hours ago are stuffed in an evidence bag at the police station. The Superman tee Jack gave me on the first night we met, my favorite pair of jeans, my once-white espadrilles. All ruined.<br> <br>My body is an afterimage of the damage, a map of dark red told in streaks and smears. Jack&#x2019;s blood is on my face and in my hair, on my arms and under my fingernails. There was so much, the paramedics had rushed to me, checking for signs of trauma, but they couldn&#x2019;t see the hole in my heart.<br> <br>My name is Remy.<br> <br>I am seventeen years old.<br> <br>This won&#x2019;t last forever.<br> <br>Elise taught me that once as a way to keep myself grounded. These are things I can hold on to. A reminder that how I feel now won&#x2019;t be how I feel forever.<br> <br>Standing in the shower, I let the water burn the last of him off my skin, watch the blood swirl down the drain until it runs clear.<br> <br>But I can&#x2019;t get clean. Even with every last drop of shampoo and soap gone, I am still scrubbing, until my skin and scalp are raw and angry.<br> <br>Until the only thing left is a shaking, sobbing girl on the shower floor.<br> <br>A shaking, sobbing girl who has to face a loss she&#x2019;s not ready to accept. Part of me knows Jack&#x2019;s no longer here, but I just don&#x2019;t want him to be gone.<br> 2.<p></p> <br>They&#x2019;re arguing again, my parents. It&#x2019;s the only constant in my life. The sun will break over the horizon in the morning, and like clockwork, my parents will fight.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; Dad shouts, following Mom as she paces around the living room. The phone is pressed against her face as she shushes him. Her eyes hold nothing but contempt.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m calling a lawyer,&#x201d; she says, her voice a sharp hiss.<br> <br>&#x201c;No one&#x2019;s awake right now. It&#x2019;s three in the morning.&#x201d; He is exasperation and she is anger. These are the roles they&#x2019;ve played for years.<br> <br>My brother, Christian, and I sit quietly on the couch, my hair dripping, still wet from the shower. The sound of water hitting leather punctuates their screaming, a steady drumbeat to the crescendo of their anger. We don&#x2019;t look at each other, we don&#x2019;t look at them. This is so familiar it&#x2019;s almost comforting. I can&#x2019;t handle what&#x2019;s happened, but this I could manage all day long, the shouting and cutting words, my parents at each other&#x2019;s throats.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi, hello,&#x201d; Mom says when someone answers the phone. She shoots Dad a look: See? His mouth flattens into a thin line.<br> <br>They pick up right where they left off after my mother ends the call. They argue about the lawyer&#x2014;when will they be here, who is it, where did you even find them. They argue about how tired they are. They argue about what happened.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you know?&#x201d; Mom asks him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Know what, Helena?&#x201d; Dad says, palm pressed against his temple.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where your daughter was. What&#x2019;s been going on with her. God, Stephen, how useless can you be?&#x201d;<br> <br>I am right here but I say nothing. Christian peeks over at me. If he&#x2019;s concerned, he doesn&#x2019;t say anything.<br> <br>I think maybe I&#x2019;m the one who died, maybe this is my own special version of hell, watching my parents snipe at each other on loop for all eternity. Maybe this is what I deserve.<br> <br>A knock on the door finally interrupts them half an hour later and they pause when it grows louder. It&#x2019;s the lawyer.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Vera Deshpande,&#x201d; she says once she&#x2019;s in the living room, eyes searching our tense expressions. &#x201c;Tell me what happened.&#x201d;<br> <br>Everyone looks to me. When it becomes clear I am too wrecked to speak, my parents start up again all at once.<br> <br>&#x201c;Her boyfriend&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Her best friend&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s dead&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She shot him&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not Remy. Remy didn&#x2019;t shoot anyone&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I meant&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was that girl, Elise&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was all her&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know where she got a gun&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>They&#x2019;re talking over each other, and I would feel vaguely sorry for Vera if I could feel anything at all. Finally, they catch themselves and pause.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where did she get a gun?&#x201d; Mom asks, and all eyes turn to me again. I study the floor, wish I were invisible, wish I were anywhere but here, anyone but me. &#x201c;This is serious, Remy,&#x201d; Mom continues. &#x201c;You could go to prison. Do you understand?&#x201d; Condescension coats her voice, but there&#x2019;s an edge there too, sharpened by fear. &#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d; They don&#x2019;t say his name. They don&#x2019;t care about him, and they don&#x2019;t care about Elise either, even after everything.<br> <br>And I can&#x2019;t tell if they really even care about me and what happens to me or if what they really care about is how this will look for them, if their daughter goes to prison. How this will affect my mother&#x2019;s nomination to the hospital&#x2019;s board, the promotion my father&#x2019;s gunning for at Coca-Cola. How it&#x2019;ll ruin the perfect image they&#x2019;ve worked so hard to craft. We never talk about it but this is why they&#x2019;re still together, after all these battle-worn years. It&#x2019;s not important that their marriage is a failure, what&#x2019;s important is that no one knows they&#x2019;ve failed, and so the charade continues no matter the cost.<br> <br>&#x201c;Remy, please,&#x201d; Dad says, eyes pleading with me. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re trying to help you. We love you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Love, that old excuse. They love me the way they love the Mercedes in the garage, the way they love an expensive timepiece on their wrists. They love me only for what I could be to them. I am to be seen but not heard, to be had but not understood. Love is the weapon they wield when it suits them, the justification for everything they do.<br> <br>&#x201c;Remy,&#x201d; Dad tries again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be stupid,&#x201d; Mom says, cutting him off. &#x201c;Tell us everything.&#x201d;<br> <br>I hug my knees in and hide my face. It&#x2019;s a reflex to ball up, shield myself from the world when it&#x2019;s all too much. Part of me knows they&#x2019;re right to panic. I have no idea what&#x2019;ll happen to me, and underneath the shock and grief, I&#x2019;m terrified too.<br> <br>&#x201c;Remy,&#x201d; Mom says, her voice like a slap to the face. &#x201c;This is not the time to play the sullen teenager.&#x201d; She always knows exactly what to say to get a rise out of me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not playing. This isn&#x2019;t a game,&#x201d; I say, head still buried, hidden behind my legs. &#x201c;Jack&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br> <br>Words that I haven&#x2019;t allowed myself to even think now hang in the air. He&#x2019;s really gone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. And I know you&#x2019;re sad,&#x201d; Mom tries again. &#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sad?&#x201d; I can&#x2019;t believe her. She&#x2019;s always been like this. Cold, uncaring. I used to think maybe she had to cut off her emotions because she&#x2019;s a surgeon, but now I think maybe she never had any to begin with and that was precisely why she was such a good surgeon.<br> <br>She pushes on. &#x201c;But you have to think about yourself at this point. There&#x2019;s nothing you can do for him now. And do you think Jack would want you to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is that what you think when someone dies on the table? That there&#x2019;s nothing you can do for them now?&#x201d; I am screaming, struggling to contain myself. &#x201c;You would. You don&#x2019;t give a shit about anyone but yourself.&#x201d; I release my legs and grip the couch seats, knuckles white. I start to cry and it&#x2019;s a capitulation. I&#x2019;ve lost.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she says without flinching. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly what I do. I have to. Because the next person I operate on deserves my best. You can&#x2019;t just crawl into bed and shut out the world.&#x201d; She&#x2019;s right about one thing&#x2014;all I want to do is crawl into bed and shut everything out. All I want to do is sink into my pain, let it drown me. &#x201c;You have to think about what&#x2019;s in front of you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, of course, that&#x2019;s you. You&#x2019;re perfect. A machine. How can any of us ever measure up? No one was ever good enough for you. Not Dad, not me&#x2014;&#x201d; This is an old argument, these are all words I&#x2019;ve flung at her before. It&#x2019;s a strange comfort, being back here with her. Surreal but almost normal. The boy I love is dead and it feels like the world is closing in on me, but here we are sparring like always.<br> <br>&#x201c;I do what I do to survive.&#x201d; Her voice has turned deadly quiet and it&#x2019;s more terrifying than when she&#x2019;s screaming at the top of her lungs. &#x201c;I have to make hard decisions every single day. Life-or-death decisions. All you have to do is go to school, get good grades, avoid getting caught up in a murder investigation. How do you fuck that up?&#x201d;<br> <br>Christian&#x2019;s eyes are wide, but I know he won&#x2019;t step in on my behalf. He can barely look at me, eyes down on his phone. Maybe he thinks I&#x2019;m hopeless, stupid, a lost cause&#x2014;the way Mom sees me. Maybe he thinks I&#x2019;m something worse, a monster, and he can&#x2019;t stand to be in the same room as me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Helena,&#x201d; Dad says.<br> <br>Before this escalates any further, Vera cuts in. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t I talk to Remy alone,&#x201d; she says. We all stare at her blankly. We&#x2019;d forgotten she was there. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go for a drive.&#x201d;<br> <br>In her car, she doesn&#x2019;t say anything when I lower the window and light a cigarette, doesn&#x2019;t tell me to put it out or ask me if I&#x2019;m old enough to have them. My hand shakes as I smoke, my entire body unsteady. It hurts to breathe. It hurts to exist.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re just worried,&#x201d; Vera says about my parents as she starts her car. We can still hear them from the driveway, their words faint but heated.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, that&#x2019;s pretty much how they always are,&#x201d; I say, my voice flat. I am on the edge of falling asleep but I am also wide-awake. I feel dizzy, spinning between the two states.<br> <br>Vera doesn&#x2019;t respond, pulling out of our driveway. It&#x2019;s almost four in the morning and we&#x2019;re the only car on the road. The world seems both dead and infinite. We have four hours, five tops, before we&#x2019;re due at the police station. Elise was held for questioning, but they released me into the custody of my parents. I was covered in blood, I wasn&#x2019;t the shooter, so they allowed me to return for questioning in the morning.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, Remy, why don&#x2019;t I explain what we can expect this morning when we go in?&#x201d;<br> <br>Somewhere in the back of my mind I remember that today is Monday. I have a physics test I didn&#x2019;t study for, on classical mechanics, the laws of gravity and motion&#x2014;the laws that govern how the stars in a galaxy move and how a gun discharges.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll start by reading you your juvenile Miranda rights.&#x201d; Vera briefly recites the lines that remind me of crime shows on TV, and I can&#x2019;t believe this is real life. &#x201c;Then someone will take your statement,&#x201d; she continues. &#x201c;A detective, usually, but possibly a police officer. It&#x2019;s important to remain calm. First impressions do matter.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her voice comes in and out of focus as I smoke and stare at the streetlights that glide past us. The air is cool on my face and the tears fall freely. I am wrung dry, inside and out, incapable of feeling anything and overwhelmed all at once. My mind has shut down in self-preservation. I feel nothing but still the tears come.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell me what happened. All of it. Don&#x2019;t leave anything out. I&#x2019;m on your side,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;What you say to me stays in this car. But you have to tell me everything.&#x201d;<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t answer.<br> <br>&#x201c;Remy?&#x201d; Vera says, her voice a soothing balm. I turn to face her. She looks tired but her thick, dark hair is pinned into a knot and her blouse is free of wrinkles, lipstick perfect. I wonder where my mother found her, why she picked up the phone at three in the morning, why she&#x2019;s here with me instead of in bed. &#x201c;I know we just met but I need you to trust me. I need you to help me help you. I need you to tell me what happened.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I finally say, swallowing. I wonder where Elise is now. If they took her to the police station, if she&#x2019;s at the Pink Mansion, all alone, if anyone&#x2019;s called a lawyer for her too. If anyone&#x2019;s looking out for her. I&#x2019;m scared for her, I realize. I&#x2019;m scared for both of us.<br> <br>&#x201c;And don&#x2019;t lie,&#x201d; Vera says. &#x201c;I need to be prepared. The truth always comes out with these things.&#x201d;<br> 3.<p></p> <br>At the heart of every good lie is the truth, that&#x2019;s what Elise told me once. The best lies are at least half-true, she said, like it&#x2019;s just a matter of mixing paint, two different colors swirling together until no one can tell where the truth ends and the lie begins, a new color emerging.<br> <br>When the police pulled me away from Jack&#x2019;s body, they sat me at the back of an ambulance, wrapped a blanket around my shoulders, and asked me what happened. I don&#x2019;t know, I said. They didn&#x2019;t believe me, but I wasn&#x2019;t lying.<br> <br>The answer the police are looking for does not contain multitudes, the answer they want leaves no room for interpretation. They want cold, hard facts where none exist. Everyone does, Vera included.<br> <br>Yes, it&#x2019;s a fact that late Sunday night Elise, Jack, and I were at her house, known to most in the area as the Pink Mansion, named for its blush painted exterior and its massive grounds. It&#x2019;s a fact that Elise, with her grandfather&#x2019;s revolver, shot and killed Jack. It&#x2019;s a fact that I called 9-1-1, kneeled by his side crying as I held him in my arms, as if I could keep him there if I only held on hard enough.<br>...</p><h2>Intercessors &amp; Pastors : The Emerging Partnership of Watchmen &amp; Gatekeepers</h2><p>This book was written to help pray-ers and pastors establish a meaningful partnership.

Having consulted with a myriad of food and drink experts--alongside top chefs, gardeners, farmers, cheese makers and vintners--editor Domin and photographer Beer capture the essence of regional culinary traditions. Organized into 12 gastronomic provinces, the book features foods, condiments, confections, wines, spirits and liqueurs indigenous to each region. Lavishly illustrated historical sketches and sidebars expound upon French staples--baguettes (Paris), oysters (Poitou, Charentes, Limousin) and champagne (Champagne, Lorraine, Alsace)--as well as such coveted delicacies as andouillettes (chitterling pork sausage). Discussions on livestock breeding, hunting, fishing, butchery and vineyards illustrate how each region best capitalizes on its natural resources. Readers also learn about lesser known regional specialties, including Orl ans vinegar from the Loire Valley, premium Echir butter from the Poitou and Charentes region and C vennes honey made from chestnut blossoms. Incorporating local and seasonal ingredients, the recipes highlight such regional cookery as Coq Au Vin de Bourgogne, Macaronis et Truffles d'Ici (chicken cooked in Burgundy wine with macaroni and local truffles) and Bas Rond de Lapin la Gaillarde (braised rabbit, Brive-style). Tapping into a splendidly varied gastronomic landscape, this cookbook is an erudite reference that goes beyond coffee-table prettiness.

This book surveys the development of the script from the earliest pictographic signs to the latest astronomical tablets and the process by which it came to be used for writing many different Near Eastern languages. Sample texts show how the script is analyzed into words and syllables and how to read the names of the most famous kings as they appear on monuments. In addition, extracts from contemporary Sumerian literature and school texts give an account of the training of the scribes, and the various types of inscription they wrote are illustrated. The decipherment of cuneiform they wrote are illustrated. The decipherment of cuneiform is explained and - for the collector - some guidelines for the identification of fake inscriptions are given.</p><p></p><h2>Josephus: The Jewish War, Books V-VII (Loeb Classical Library No. 210) (Volume III)</h2><p><p>Josephus, soldier, statesman, historian, was a Jew born at Jerusalem about 37 CE. A man of high descent, he early became learned in Jewish law and Greek literature and was a Pharisee. After pleading in Rome the cause of some Jewish priests he returned to Jerusalem and in 66 tried to prevent revolt against Rome, managing for the Jews the affairs of Galilee. In the troubles which followed he made his peace with Vespasian. Present at the siege of Jerusalem by Titus, he received favours from these two as emperors and from Domitian and assumed their family name Flavius. He died after 97.</p><p>As a historical source Josephus is invaluable. His major works are: <i>History of the Jewish War</i>, in seven books, from 170 BCE to his own time, first written in Aramaic but translated by himself into the Greek we now have; and <i>Jewish Antiquities</i>, in twenty books, from the creation of the world to 66 CE.

Unlike farmhouses, castles or manors, villas usually belong to city dwellers. The villa provides a focus for examining not only the relationship between urban and rural life, but also that between building and the environment, and between the effects of social, economic and political change on architectural design. The author illuminates villas of all kinds in a study of one of the most attractive types of dwelling ever conceived.</p><p>"To read this stimulating book is to meet an erudite scholar who has thought a great deal about the subject, and is willing to entertain, as well as inform, to patiently explain, as well as to make pronouncements."<b>--Witold Rybczynski, <i>The New York Review of Books</i><br> </b><br>"Among the several histories of the country house published in 1990 this is easily the best. . . .

More than 500 physical features - craters, seas, mountain ranges, peaks, valleys and rilles (elongated depressions) - are named and indexed, and the landing sites of unmanned and manned spacecraft are also marked. The observer can thus readily identify objects seen through binoculars or a telescope, or pick targets for a program of observation.;The accompanying text is a practical guide to Moonwatching, which explains how to use the map and highlights the most interesting lunar features. Close-up images of some of these objects show what the observer can expect to see. Also included are photographs of the Moon at each daily stage and a smaller map of the far side, as revealed by satellites.

What if a microchip could identify your perfect match? What if it could be used against you and the ones you love? Eight years ago, Mercer Corporation&#39;s M-Bands became mandatory. An evolution of the smartphone, the bracelets promised an easier life. Instead, they have come to control it. Two years ago, Maggie Stevens watched helplessly as one of the people she loved most was taken from her, shattering her world as she knew it. Now, Maggie is ready. And Quentin Mercer - heir to the M-Corp empire - has become key to Maggie&#39;s plan. But as the pieces of her dangerous design fall into place, could Quentin&#39;s involvement destroy everything she&#39;s fought for? In a world full of broken promises, the ones Maggie must keep could be the most heartbreaking. Ages 14+</p><p>Jessica Shirvington lives in Sydney with her husband of ten years, Foxtel presenter and former Olympic sprinter Matt Shirvington, and their two daughters. She has previously founded and run a coffee distribution company, Stella Imports, in London, and been involved in managing the restaurants Fuel Bistro, Tow Bar and MG Garage in Sydney. She is currently a full-time mum, author and co-director in the company MPS Investments Pty Ltd.Gr 8 Up&#x2014;A fast-paced and frightening dystopian series opener. What if you could wear a smartwatchlike band that could tell you when you're getting stressed or tired or who your next best friend or even soul mate will be? In Maggie Stevens's world, such technology is a reality&#x2014;and a requirement. Advanced Phera-tech allows people to match up based on their pheromone readings; couples can be enemies, friends, "lust-matches," or even good marriage candidates, and there's the nearly impossible "perfect match." Maggie's father is locked away in a prison for being a "neg," or someone who garners only negative readings with others&#x2014;a sign of a criminal or otherwise unstable person. The protagonist knows her father is not a neg, so she blackmails the heir to the M-Corp fortune, Quentin Mercer, to help her find her dad. What she doesn't expect is that the person she thinks is her enemy is someone entirely different and that those she loves can be her enemies. As Maggie grapples with whether to trust the Phera-tech ratings or her own instincts, vast conspiracies are unraveled and she must choose between her heart and her head. With heaps of action and suspense, along with a realistically imperfect heroine, this title is a take on a world that is not far from plausible&#x2014;where we are all controlled by bands on our wrists. VERDICT Fans of Victoria Aveyard's The Red Queen and Marie Lu's "The Young Elites" will enjoy Shirvington's energetic writing style and fresh spin on oppressive future technologies.&#x2014;Amanda Buschmann, Carroll Elementary, Houston, TX</p><h2>Lola Loves Stories</h2><p>Lovable Lola is back in this imaginative sequel to the best-selling LOLA AT THE LIBRARY.<br><br>Lola loves to go to the library with her daddy.

Now, with <i>Farewell, Fred Voodoo</i>, she gives us a vivid portrayal of the extraordinary people living in this stark place. <br><br>Wilentz traces the country&#x2019;s history from its slave plantations through its turbulent revolutionary history, its kick-up-the-dirt guerrilla movements, its totalitarian dynasty that ruled for decades, and its long and always troubled relationship with the United States. Yet through a history of hardship shines Haiti&#x2019;s creative culture&#x2014;its African traditions, its French inheritance, and its uncanny resilience, a strength that is often confused with resignation. <br><br>Haiti emerged from the dust of the 2010 earthquake like a powerful spirit, and this stunning book describes the country&#x2019;s day-to-day struggle and its relationship to outsiders who come to help out. There are human-rights reporters gone awry, movie stars turned aid workers, priests and musicians running for president, doctors turned diplomats. A former U.S. president works as a house builder and voodoo priests try to control elections. <br><br>A foreign correspondent on a simple story becomes, over time and in the pages of this book, a lover of Haiti, pursuing the essence of this beautiful and confounding land into its darkest and brightest corners. <i>Farewell, Fred Voodoo </i>is a spiritual journey into the heart of the human soul, and Haiti has found in Amy Wilentz an author of astonishing wit, sympathy, and eloquence.</p><p><b>Amy Wilentz</b> is the author of <i>The Rainy Season</i>, <i>Martyrs&#x2019; Crossing</i>, and <i>I Feel Earthquakes More Often Than They Happen</i>.

Here are the things that touch me, but a warning: they are not entirely normal. ... [One is a] bone in a burned foot. The man sits in a broken wheelchair&#x2014;he&#x2019;s young, maybe twenty-two. He&#x2019;s a friend of Jerry and Samuel&#x2019;s. He was riding on his motorbike in the middle of a post-quake, pre-election demonstration when a government thug, so he says, took a potshot at him. The bullet went through his abdomen, and he was in such shock that his foot got caught in the bike&#x2019;s muffler and burned. They took him to the general hospital, where doctors repaired the bullet&#x2019;s damage and left a big scar along his abdomen, which he matter-of-factly shows to anyone who asks, but the foot was left to heal on its own with no skin graft, and now, three months after the injury, you can still see the entirely exposed three inches of metatarsal bone through a blood-red hole in the top of his foot, like a peek at the guy&#x2019;s skeleton, as he sits there in his unwheeled wheelchair in a stony fury over his situation. <br><br>&nbsp; <br><br>Another item in my list of what moves me here: the death of the woman who hated me. Just after the earthquake, I had a spaghetti dinner&#x2014;this was the one made by the <i>New York Times</i>&#x2019;s Haiti reporting team&#x2014;in the kitchen of the half-destroyed Park Hotel. You had to walk under hanging cement and over broken floors to get to the lobby, and then tiptoe through the perilous lobby to the kitchen. One of the Haiï¿½tians staying there, behind the rubble of the front rooms, was a Madame Coupet, an older, very light-skinned Haitian lady, <i>wouj,</i> actually, who was wearing a housedress. Her son was in America. <br><br>She had heard of the book I had published on Haiti many years earlier. How she had hated me then, she told me now&#x2014;well, I had supï¿½ported Aristide, she had gathered, and he was the man she held responï¿½sible for everything bad that had happened in the past twenty-five years. For this earthquake, even, it seemed. I bowed my head. What could I tell her? She wouldn&#x2019;t have wanted to hear what I wanted to say. But we talked about other things&#x2014;her children, her family, Haiti&#x2014;and in the end, we got along. She decided that I was not a demon, and that we both loved Haiti. She was surprised that I seemed nice. Polite. Well-broughtï¿½up, is how the Haitians say it. <br><br>After I left the country, I thought of Madame Coupet often, and longed to see her again. I wanted to talk to her, because I needed to hear more about old Haiti, the lost country, the country she said she loved. I thought of her mottled skin, its fairness ruined by age and the Haitian sun, of her gracious diction, and of her generosity in forgiving me for Aristide&#x2014;and of mine in forgiving her for forgiving me for Aristide. When I came back to Port-au-Prince, five months after the earthquake, the middle-aged men sitting in metal chairs on the still rubble-strewn terrace of the Park Hotel, smoking cigarettes and gossiping with one another, told me the old lady had died. They wanted to tell me gently but didn&#x2019;t know how. So they told me bluntly: she died. Therefore, no interview. But I can still tell you what she might have said, or at any rate, what someone like her might have said. Here it is: <br><br>When I was a girl, there were lace curtains. The wind was sweet. I had a pet cat and she would chase the guinea fowl in the courtyard. I had a blue dress with a sash that only my mother knew how to tie properly. The frangipani tree in the corner of the garden smelled like my mother&#x2019;s perfume. There was Duvalier, sure: Papa Doc. But we children, me and my brothers, we paid very little attention. My parents tried to keep out of his way, I suppose. My father was a professor at the university, an engiï¿½neer. My brothers and I, we read poetry, Durand, Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Morisseau-Leroy, Roumer, and meanwhile the bougainvillea tumbled over the front wall and there were plants in pots in the gardens and two servants, and one poor distant girl cousin who helped with chores. She was from the deep country, and did marry, finally. In summers we went to my aunt&#x2019;s house in the mountains and picked flowers and rode donkeys and helped make the morning coffee. I went to school in a checkered uniform that I loved. I read French literature until I met my husband, who was in the import-export business. I was beautiful, and he loved me until I grew old. We had two children, and a third who died in childbirth. Now one is dead and the other lives in New Jersey. I prefer to be here where I understand things. <br><br>&nbsp; <br><br>Here&#x2019;s something that got to me: the last time I saw Filibert Waldeck. The last time I saw Filibert, I was standing in front of the ruined catheï¿½dral downtown. It was January 12, 2011, the first anniversary of the earthquake. People were praying under the statue of Jesus that still stands outside the rubble. A man rushed up and exhibited his little daughter to me. She had, to put it nicely, failure to thrive. She must have been five but she looked two, with huge eyes, reddish hair, bone-thin limbs. The man told me they&#x2019;d been homeless since the earthquake. A person nearby told me, while the man was standing there in front of me with his silent child balanced in his arms, that that fellow came to the cathedral ruins with the kid every day looking for some visitor to beg from. Did that make his story less true? I asked myself. The crowd pressed on us and the man and his daughter were shoved away. There was a band playing, and there were priests and nuns seated, waiting for the service to begin. I was standing off to the side near a white man I&#x2019;d never seen before, an older man with thinning hair. &nbsp; <br><br>As usual with any big Haitian event, huge numbers of people were all shoved together in a giant bubbling human mass. The white man near me was at least five people away. Although we were outside, there was barely room to inhale where we stood, but uncannily, up in front of my face popped someone I recognized. At first I wasn&#x2019;t sure who he was, exactly. Then he spoke in his familiar growl of a voice, the same rasp he&#x2019;d had as a child, only deeper. It was Filibert, wearing some kind of satanic red and silver T-shirt and old dirty jeans. He was too thin. <br><br>I said, &#x201c;Filibert, what&#x2019;s wrong with you?&#x201d; He wasn&#x2019;t making sense. The white man standing near me was watching. He pushed his way forï¿½ward and took Filibert by the arm and rattled him, shook him up a bit. I was astonished. Filibert looked astonished, too, if you can look astonï¿½ished while looking sullen. The white man, whose self-assured demeanor I now recognized as that of a lay Christian brother of some kind, was interrogating Filibert. He called him by his full name: &#x201c;Filibert Waldeck, what&#x2019;s wrong with you?&#x201d; <br><br>Filibert just shook his head, looked down at the ground. The man looked at me and back at Filibert. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re on crack or something, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; he asked him. &#x201c;I know it. I know it.&#x201d; The man shook his head and tried to peer into Filibert&#x2019;s eyes, but Filibert looked away. <br><br>&#x201c;You stop that stuff, do you hear me?&#x201d; The man was speaking fluent Creole. <br><br>I took Filibert aside and he began that same long rant I&#x2019;d already heard about his sons and their mother and about how he had to keep them inside so she wouldn&#x2019;t get them, and how his motorbike had broken down and he didn&#x2019;t have money to get it fixed. Throughout the whole long saga, which was much more detailed and a lot less comï¿½prehensible than what I am putting down here, he would look at me sideways, slantwise, assessing my potential. Half the time he had the demeanor of a person on drugs or in the throes of mental illness of some kind, which I&#x2019;ve always suspected with him. And the rest of the time, he looked like a smart old market lady sizing up her client. Finally, I asked him if I could help him in any way, and he just looked at me. <br><br>&#x201c;Amy, you ahr my mozzer,&#x201d; he said to me, in English. So I gave him some money. And then he disappeared into the crowd. I saw a splotch of red fading away down toward Grande Rue. My child, I thought. I tried to imagine it. I wondered if there had really ever been any connection between us, other than monetary. Because of where I was from, I had always had the power in our relationship. Because of where he was from, Filibert was always the weak one, poor, needy, desperate. Of course we each bore some responsibility for who we were and how we had ended up, but we were also prisoners of our fates, each of us locked in our individual history and geography. I was from the U.S. and he was from Haiti. That was it. I always had and gave money; he always did not have it and needed it. It was always my choice: would I give him something? How much, this time? It was easy, even pleasurable, for me to give it to him; but it was all cruel for him. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crowd around me was singing a spindly soprano hymn as the memorial service began. But where was Filibert going now? Why didn&#x2019;t he have a cell phone? Why didn&#x2019;t he have my number? And now that speck of red had vanished. I squinted into the sun, trying to find him again, but he had slipped back away into the heat and darkness, and was lost to me.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; <br><br>As I am writing this, at around five in the morning, I hear gunfire and screaming outside my window. Two shots. Ridiculous, it cannot be, but it is. Freelance fire, I figure&#x2014;meaningless gang shit. In the old days violence had political meaning in Haiti, but, as elsewhere in the world, now it&#x2019;s often pretty pointless. More gunfire now. Definitely gunfire. And screaming and a rumble of low shouting, as if a whole crowd is yelling far away. Carnival is coming, I remember; that can be a violent time. And elections are coming: that also means violence. First I get up to go to the window to look: when I peek out from a sharp sideways angle, I see a crowd down on the street below, pushing and shoving, and screaming. It&#x2019;s violent, and that&#x2019;s definitely where the shooting has been coming from. Maybe it <i>is</i> some kind of political protest, I think now. I retract my head as another round of shooting begins, and return to my desk. <br><br>Later, when I interviewed some acquaintances in the neighborhood, I discovered that the reason for the shooting and screaming and the angry nub of a crowd in the street was that the pharmacy down below my window had announced the previous day that it would be offering to fill children&#x2019;s prescriptions for free today, in a one-day trial program. The crowd was composed of mothers, all fighting to get in before the place stopped serving. The shooter was the pharmacy owner, trying to protect his place from the poverty-maddened consumers. I&#x2019;d mistaken the mothï¿½ers for a politically motivated riot. And, in a way, they were.</p><h2>Justice League: The Detroit Era Omnibus</h2><p>With tales that span from the 1980s to current day, this oversize omnibus edition collects for the first time in chronologic order every appearance of the Justice League Detroit.

The friends and family of depressed people are emotionally at risk themselves, for they can become "fused" with the depressed person--that is, become locked in a mutually harmful cycle whereby negative behaviors in one partner beget negative behaviors in the other. This vicious cycle, which Podell believes can occur in any relationship (even one with a pet), is particularly insidious when depression is a factor, because the nondepressed person can so easily believe that he or she is helping the depressed one. This, writes Podell, is "codependency any way you slice it." First describing fusion in a relationship, Podell next shows readers how to "defuse" 'first' earlier in sentence by managing themselves and then the loved one, and finally explores the process of reconstruction after defusion. Similar to other codependency manuals, this one, written with freelancer Shimer, also urges the reader to consider the partner's needs as well as his or her own, but without becoming a martyr. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Boys Over Flowers, Vol. 25</h2><p>Even though she is poor, Tsukushi Makino attends an elite school for the super rich, but when she becomes intertwined with the F4--the ruling boys of the school--the entire student body starts bullying her and not even the right clothes or friends can help her.</p><p></p><h2>Christopher&#39;s Ghosts</h2><p>It is the late 1930s, and young Christopher and his family are struggling against the rise of Nazi totalitarianism in Berlin.

However, further investigation proves the seemingly simple robbery to have been impossible. Inspector Robert Colbeck knows this is a case that won&#x2019;t be easily solved. He is faced with the question of how the robbers got into a safe with two keys that were secure at opposite sides of the country. To get to the bottom of the mystery, he enlists the aid of volatile former policeman Brendan Mulryne behind his Superintendent&#x2019;s back to search out the criminals in the notorious Devil&#x2019;s Acre, a cluster of gambling dens in the shadow of Westminster Abbey. However, it may turn out that Mulryne can create more trouble than he can cure.<br><br>Things get even more complicated as the beautiful daughter of the injured train driver, Madeleine Andrews, comes to Colbeck to provide information, unwittingly drawing the attentions of the crooks. When prime suspects begin to disappear and he learns that there was more than just money on the train, Colbeck realizes that he is dealing with the most driven and powerful criminal he has faced in his career. As the very citizens he is trying to protect begin to be affected by this mastermind, Colbeck must join Mulryne in a race against time before all the evidence is efficiently blown away.<br><br>The Railway Detective is an action-packed dip into murky 1850s London. Full of twists and with memorable characters, this is a mystery that will surprise you at every turn.</p><p>Edward Marston was born and brought up in South Wales. A full-time writer for over thirty years, he has worked in radio, film, television and the theatre. Prolific and highly successful, he is equally at home writing children&#x2019;s books or literary criticism, plays or biographies and the settings for his crime novels range from the world of professional golf to the compilation of the Domesday Survey. He is also a former Chairman of the Crime Writers Association.The prolific Marston (the Domesday Books series, etc.) starts yet another historical mystery series with this middling police procedural that starts well but runs out of steam. Robert Colbeck, a former attorney now serving as an inspector in the fledging Scotland Yard of 1851, investigates a daring daylight train robbery that results in the derailment of the train and the theft of gold and mail. Later, those initially suspected of having provided the inside information that enabled the scheme's startling and speedy success turn up dead, while someone begins to blackmail members of the upper-class with the stolen letters. The spirited byplay among Colbeck, his rule-bound superintendent and his sergeant recalls Peter Lovesey's superlative Sergeant Cribb novels. But while Colbeck is a bright, unconventional and imaginative sleuth, Marston's choice to unmask the crimes' prime movers halfway through and to reduce an engaging female character, the daughter of the train's driver, into a stereotypical damsel in distress ultimately disappoints. One hopes Colbeck's next exploit will offer a more suspenseful, sophisticated plot. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

'Bennie Logan done all right for himself, didn't he, Mrs Pargeter?' </p><p> 'Yes,' the plump, white-haired lady in the back of the limousine agreed. 'Pity he didn't live longer to enjoy it.' </p><p> What Bennie Logan didn't live longer to enjoy was the Elizabethan manor house up whose drive they were proceeding at an appropriately decorous pace. The exceptionally warm September afternoon showed the building at its best. Chastaigne Varleigh was a monument to elegance in discreetly mellowed red brick, punctuated here and there by fine leaded windows. It had been sympathetically restored to its earlier magnificence, and the surrounding grounds showed the same punctilious attention to cosmetic detail. No mole would have dared to break through the even green of the lawns, no weed would have had the effrontery to poke up through the valeted gravel that led to the front door of Chastaigne Varleigh. </p><p> Mrs Pargeter's pull on the chain of the doorbell was answered by Veronica Chastaigne. What the house's owner saw on her doorstep was a well-upholstered woman in a bright silk print dress. The visitor had beautifully cut white hair, and her body tapered down to surprisingly elegant ankles and surprisingly high-heeled shoes. There was about the woman an aura of comfort and ease. Though this was their first encounter, Veronica Chastaigne felt as if they had met before, and as if here was someone in whom she would have no difficulty in confiding anything. </p><p> The house's interior reflected the same care and discreet opulence as its exterior. The sitting room into which Veronica Chastaigne ushered her guest was oak-panelled, but prevented from being gloomy by the bright prints which Upholstered its sofas and armchairs. Sunlight, beaming through the tall leaded windows, enriched their glow. The room had nothing to prove; it manifested the casual ease of the genuine aristocrat, to whom such surroundings were nothing unusual. </p><p> And Veronica Chastaigne looked as if she had lived in them from birth. Though now nearly eighty, she still had a majesty in her gaunt features, an ancestral hauteur in the long bony fingers that handled the silver and fine china of the coffee tray. But she quickly disabused her guest of the notion that she had always lived in the house. </p><p> 'Oh, no,' her effortlessly patrician vowels pronounced. 'Bennie changed our surname to Chastaigne when we bought the place.' </p><p> Mrs Pargeter looked appropriately surprised. 'I'd assumed Chastaigne Varleigh had been in your family for generations.' </p><p> The older woman chuckled. 'I'm afraid nothing stayed in my family for very long -- estates, paintings, jewellery -- it all had to be sold off eventually. We were the original titled spendthrifts. Bennie was the one who accumulated things.' </p><p> She then showed Mrs Pargeter some of the 'things' that her late husband had 'accumulated'. They were hung in a panelled Long Gallery which ran the length of the third floor of the house, and some of them were very old 'things' indeed. Old Masters, in fact. Though Mrs Pargeter had no formal training in art, she could recognize the translucence of a Giotto, the russet hues of a Rembrandt, the softened shadows of a Leonardo. And, coming more up to date, she had no difficulty identifying the haziness of Turner, the geometry of Mondrian, the tortured whorls of Van Gogh. (In artistic appreciation, she had always followed the precept of the late Mr Pargeter: 'I don't know much about art, but I know what it's worth.') </p><p> 'They're quite magnificent,' she breathed to her hostess in awestruck tones. </p><p> 'Yes, not bad, are they?' Veronica agreed briskly. </p><p> Then came the innocent enquiry, 'Do you open the gallery to the public, Mrs Chastaigne?' </p><p> The elderly aristocrat got as near to blushing as her upbringing would allow. 'No, I don't think that would be quite the thing.' In response to an interrogative stare, she continued, 'You see, my dear, all of these paintings are...in the terminology of the criminal fraternity...hot.' </p><p> Mrs Pargeter nodded comfortably. 'Oh. I see.' </p><p> It was after six o'clock when they returned to the sitting room. 'Certainly time for sherry,' Veronica Chastaigne announced in a tone which admitted no possibility of disagreement. </p><p> Not that Mrs Pargeter would have disagreed, anyway. She was of the belief that there were quite enough unpleasant things in life, and that it was therefore the duty of the individual to indulge in the pleasant ones at every opportunity. She raised her crystal glass of fine Amontillado to catch the rays of the September evening sun. </p><p> 'Cheers,' she said, waiting patiently for the information which she knew must come. Veronica Chastaigne had invited her to Chastaigne Varleigh for a purpose. Soon she would discover what that purpose was. </p><p> But the old lady was in nostalgic mood, caught in bitter-sweet reminiscence of her late husband. 'No woman could have asked for a more considerate companion than Bennie. Or more loving. The moment he first burst on to my horizon when I was twenty-one years old, I was totally bowled over. I'd never met anyone like him.' </p><p> 'Oh?' Mrs Pargeter knew to a nicety how minimal the prompts to confidence needed to be. </p><p> Veronica chuckled. 'Could have come from another planet. You see, up to that point my social life had all been the "season" and hunt balls. I'd been surrounded by chinless wonders. People of "our own sort". The "right class of person".' </p><p> 'So your parents didn't approve of Bennie?' </p><p> 'Hardly. They were absolutely appalled. Mind you, I was far better off with him than I would have been with any of the titled peabrains they were offering. And the day we were married, Bennie promised that he would keep me in the lifestyle to which I was accustomed.' </p><p> 'Hence Chastaigne Varleigh?' </p><p> 'Yes. And, er, the pictures.' The old lady gave a sweet and innocent smile. 'I never thought it proper to enquire into the sources of my husband's wealth.' </p><p> 'Very wise.' Mrs Pargeter had had a similar arrangement with the late Mr Pargeter. </p><p> 'Shortly before Bennie died...' Veronica Chastaigne spoke more slowly as she approached the real purpose of their encounter, 'he assured me that, if ever I needed any assistance...assistance, that is, in matters where an approach to the police would not have been the appropriate course of action...' </p><p> Mrs Pargeter nodded. She knew exactly what the older woman meant. </p><p> '...I should contact his "good mate", Mr Pargeter.' She focused faded blue eyes on her guest. 'I was therefore not a little surprised when my summons was answered by you rather than by your husband.' </p><p> 'I'm sorry to say that Mr Pargeter is also...no longer with us.' </p><p> 'Ah.' </p><p> 'Dead,' Mrs Pargeter amplified readily. </p><p> 'I understood the first time.' Veronica Chastaigne's face became thoughtful, and even a little disappointed. 'Mmm. So perhaps I will have to look elsewhere for assistance...' </p><p> 'Don't you believe it,' Mrs Pargeter hastened to reassure her. 'I regard it as a point of honour to discharge all of my husband's unfinished business.' </p><p> This news brought a sparkle back to the old lady's eye. Her guest leant enthusiastically forward in her armchair. 'So tell me -- what is it needs doing?' </p><p> There was only a moment's hesitation before Veronica Chastaigne also leant forward and began to share the problem that had caused her to summon Mrs Pargeter to Chastaigne Varleigh. </p><p> Copyright ï¿½ 1998 by Simon Brett</p></p><h2>Shells (Eyewitness Handbooks)</h2><p>A guide to seashells from around the world provides color photographs and concise descriptions of more than 500 species of seashells</p><p></p><h2>Wireless</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Stross&#x2019;s work offers a potent reminder of why short stories used to be the preferred delivery method for science fiction.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>The A.V.

Larkin (&#39;the magnificent Eeyore of British verse&#39; - Daily Telegraph) has moved home; surrounded by packing cases, playing selections from his favourite jazz LPs, and making himself cups of tea - and later whiskies - he reflects wryly on writing and life. Hilarious and moving, the narrative shifts seamlessly between Larkin&#39;s outrageous wit and the poems, which Courtenay reads with powerful directness and simplicity. PHILIP LARKIN, one of the foremost figures in 20th-Century English poetry, feared his epitaph would be: &#39;They fuck you up, your mum and dad&#39;.

It also doesn&#x2019;t take a pretty girl with pigtails and a pooch named Toto to tell you that there is absolutely, positively, no place like home.</p><p>Just thinking about wizards and terriers makes me wish I were Dorothy&#x2014;sleepily opening my eyes to Auntie Em placing a cold rag on my forehead. In my case it would be Kissie sitting at my bedside with a jumbo cold compress. &#x201c;Wake up, baby,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve just had a bad bad dream.&#x201d;</p><p>It was a dream all right, it just wasn&#x2019;t mine.</p><p>Fourteen months and a mound of heartache later, my compass is pointing south again, and my speedometer is creeping toward eighty. Despite having three unlikely Vermont comrades helping me to find the road back, an old German wicked witch named Helga hindered that road, making it rockier than the Appalachian Trail not twenty miles from the front door of my Vermont inn. Not only did she swindle me out of both my business and my marriage, she despised my own terrier&#x2014;a small, helpless Yorkie by the name of Princess Grace Kelly. Gracie couldn&#x2019;t stand Helga, either; probably one of the reasons her little heart finally pooped out. Even though she&#x2019;s forever buried up in the freezing cold North, I&#x2019;ve got the cross from her grave sitting right here on the passenger&#x2019;s seat next to me on our way back home.</p><p>I can see home in the distance. The parallelogram of Tennessee on the welcome sign slowly emerges the closer I get. The February sun is setting to the right of it and as I roll over the state line my heart rate seems to slow down. A calm washes over me like a warm shot of Grand Marnier, sliding down my throat and coating my insides. It&#x2019;s been over a year since I&#x2019;ve been home and I wouldn&#x2019;t doubt it if I&#x2019;ve given myself early high blood pressure.</p><p>We&#x2019;ve been driving for three days&#x2014;my two little girls and me&#x2014;1,473 miles due south. Sarah and Isabella are in the backseat and I steal another peek at them in my rearview mirror. Their little heads are resting against the sides of their car seats, the monotony of the boundless pavement finally lulling them to sleep. For the first time all day it&#x2019;s quiet.</p><p>Since leaving Vermont, in one heck of a nor&#x2019;easter I might add, I&#x2019;ve paid equal attention to the traffic and my heartstrings. It is a wonder we haven&#x2019;t rear-ended anyone, and an even bigger one that my sultry grin isn&#x2019;t yet a permanent fixture on my face. Between New York and Pennsylvania all I&#x2019;ve thought about is the man who stole my heart&#x2014;and who, only hours ago, sealed our months of longing with a not-so-chaste kiss in George Clark&#x2019;s gas station parking lot. Peter Owen saved my restaurant and my pride when my husband left me for a blond bombshell with a face and bosoms only money could&#x2014;and did&#x2014;buy. Helga is the one responsible for their meeting, just one of the many &#x201c;wicked witch&#x201d; maneuvers she employed as part of her nasty scheme to repossess our inn.</p><p>The rest stops between Pennsylvania and Virginia were punctuation marks in my romantic recollecting. A stream of consciousness brewed in my mind: when Peter and I danced to Van Morrison&#x2019;s &#x201c;Into the Mystic,&#x201d; the first time I tasted his white chocolate mousse, and the moment in the kitchen after my inn&#x2019;s grand opening when we both knew the sparks flying weren&#x2019;t just from the faulty stove.</p><p>And now, in Tennessee, some seventy-two hours have passed but I&#x2019;m reduced to schoolgirl antics, playing our sole kiss over and over in my mind. I&#x2019;ve run that kiss through my head, every minute detail, a thousand times already. How he tasted, how his lips felt against mine, the way his tongue moved slowly around my mouth, and how my heart swirled and danced under his touch. I suppose I&#x2019;ll have to live on that memory until the first time he comes to town. Memphis in May, perhaps? That&#x2019;s the perfect time of year. He&#x2019;ll arrive for the Beale Street Music Festival and stay for the whole month. After all, May means Mud Season back in Vermont. And Mud Season, or &#x201c;The Thaw&#x201d; as the Vermonters call it, means there won&#x2019;t be any work for him there. Heck, the whole state practically shuts down during that time.</p><p>Springtime in Memphis, however, is glorious. We&#x2019;ll go to the Memphis in May Barbecue Festival and the Sunset Symphony together. We&#x2019;ll watch the ducks walk the red carpet at the Peabody Hotel and we&#x2019;ll hang out with Virginia and John, Mary Jule and Al, Alice and Richard, and we&#x2019;ll&nbsp;... the girls will die when I show up unannounced. I cannot wait to see the look on Virginia Murphey&#x2019;s face when I pull up in her driveway in oh, about eight more hours. I figure it&#x2019;ll probably be that late by the time my daughters and I go to a drive-through for dinner and take at least three more tee-tee breaks. She and John will be sound asleep but I&#x2019;ll call her cell and she&#x2019;ll answer anyway. It won&#x2019;t be the first time I&#x2019;ve dialed her at one in the morning.</p><p>Of course Alice, the bossiest of the three, will wonder why in the world I didn&#x2019;t come to her house. Mary Jule might be disappointed, too, but she would never question any decision I make. It&#x2019;s hard having to choose between three best friends. The only reason I&#x2019;m driving to Virginia&#x2019;s house is because, well, honestly, she knows me the best. You can&#x2019;t room with someone all four years of college, and every summer in between, and not know everything there is to know about each other. Virginia knows that I wax my bikini line, and I know about the few little hairs that grow around her nipples and how she sometimes lets them grow too long and forgets to shave them. Modesty goes out the window when you&#x2019;re living with someone you&#x2019;ve known since the age of five.</p><p>Alice and Mary Jule know plenty of my secrets, too, but there&#x2019;s just something about Virginia that soothes me. She&#x2019;s got a calming effect on my soul. Perhaps that&#x2019;s because she&#x2019;s never one time judged me about anything, or maybe it&#x2019;s just as plain and simple as the fact that we&#x2019;ve never been interested in the same man. Our types are completely opposite. She likes more of a girl&#x2019;s guy and I&#x2019;ve always been attracted to the guy&#x2019;s guy. John is perfectly happy to shop with her all day long. He&#x2019;s also the type to wear a Lily tie or lime-green shorts. I prefer the rugged look. I&#x2019;ll take a man who wears a Henley shirt over an argyle sweater, any day of the week.</p><p>Virgy&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what I call her&#x2014;and I just flat-out love one another. To this day, we&#x2019;ve never been in a single fight. Actually, that&#x2019;s not quite true. The closest Virginia has come to scolding me in our twenty-nine-year friendship was when I let my husband talk me into moving to Vermont in the first place. And now, truth be told, she had every right.</p><p>I got the idea from Mama. She had always told me that being a good wife meant following your husband. She claimed she didn&#x2019;t really want to move to Memphis, either, away from Greenwood, Mississippi, but she did it because it&#x2019;s what Daddy wanted her to do. &#x201c;It would have been one thing,&#x201d; she used to say, &#x201c;to move to Jackson. Several of my best friends from Ole Miss lived there.&#x201d; Kissie told me that she had once overheard a phone conversation between Mama and one of her friends. Said my grandfather told Daddy that he&#x2019;d teach him to be a great farmer if he&#x2019;d just dig his heels into the Mississippi Delta and not move to Memphis. He told Daddy that all the cotton land stretched out as far as the eye could see could be his, if he&#x2019;d just lay his roots down in Mississippi and leave Mama right where she belonged, in her own hometown. Like me, Mama was an only child.</p><p>But Daddy&#x2019;s roots couldn&#x2019;t be planted in the middle of a cotton field. Daddy told him, &#x201c;Mr. Grov&#x2019;a, I appreciate the off&#x2019;a, but I don&#x2019;t need your cotton fields. I&#x2019;ve got a cotton family business waiting on me two hours naw&#x2019;th of here and I won&#x2019;t have to get dirt under my finga&#x2019;nails. I&#x2019;ll buy your cotton and won&#x2019;t ever have to break a sweat.&#x201d; Daddy wasn&#x2019;t the farmer type. He&#x2019;d rather work out of his old warehouse on Front Street, or Cotton Row as they call it, right in the middle of all the buying and selling.</p><p>I was raised in a stand-by-your-man household, and I also happened to fall head-over-heels in love with a football quarterback I first saw in the tenth grade. Even though my red-and-blue cheerleading skirt barely covered my backside, Baker Satterfield never looked my way, all because my chest was flat. That all changed, though, the summer before my senior year. When I ran out onto the football field that fall, pom-poms raised high above my head, my bosoms had blossomed into a natural size D, almost overnight. That man took notice of me then, and after swapping class rings, numerous road trips from Ole Miss to UT, horrendous long-distance telephone bills, and a proposal that would make even Scarlett O&#x2019;Hara swoon, we finally tied the knot a couple of years after we both graduated from college. We had, at least at first, what I would call a wonderful marriage: two beautiful daughters, a gorgeous home in Memphis, lifelong friends, great sex, and a social life that involved peach daiquiris and other succulent activities. So when my true love told me of his lifelong desire to open an inn in Vermont&#x2014;well, I had to follow my man.</p><p>Turns out my man followed something of his own and left our barely opened B&amp;B, our girls, and our dog, not to mention our dream life, in my (then) manicured hands. Leaving my beloved Memph...</p></p><h2>KEYSTONE CANOEING A Guide to Canoeable Water of Eastern Pennsylvania</h2><p>Book is organized by major watersheds, starting in the east.

Original.</p><p>In 1849, Sarah Hancock finds herself agreeing to her dying mother's wish that she marry her childhood friend Adam Rutledge. The problem is that while she loves Adam as a friend, it isn't the kind of love she'd dreamed of, the kind her parents had. After her mother's death, Sarah reluctantly leaves New Haven, Conn., and travels to Fort Charles, a remote outpost in Indian territory where Adam is stationed as an army captain. Sarah soon questions the wisdom of her promise when Adam's tyrannical aunt, "the Mrs. Colonel," finds her totally unsuitable and demands that she behave in a manner more befitting a proper army life. All seems despair, until handsome army scout Orion Beaudine appears on the scene. It's love at first sight, but Wulf (The Irish Rose) takes far too long getting the two together. Eventually it develops into a satisfying romance, but readers will feel that they didn't have enough time with the main love interest. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Finding a Place Called Home: A Guide to African-American Genealogy and Historical Identity, Revised and Expanded</h2><p>"I teach the kings of their ancestors so that the lives of the ancients might serve them as an example, for the world is old but the future springs from the past."<br>Mamadou Kouyate "Sundiata", An Epic of Old Mali, a.d. 1217-1257<br><br>Two major questions of the ages are: Who am I? and Where am I going?

On a much more mundane (and human) level is the "Kilroy" impulse: <i>I lived!</i> You needn't look hard to find evidence of this temporal communication: graffiti is as old as humanity, and latter-day taggers are following in the footsteps of Greek mercenaries (who left their names all over Egyptian monuments, Lord Byron (who carved his name into the Temple of Poseidon), and legions of anonymous ancient scribblers.<p> So, humans want and are able to communicate (wordlessly and otherwise) over thousands of years. But, asks Benford, can we accurately convey information over millions of years, or longer? We may need to do just that in order to responsibly protect future beings from our current, long-reaching messages--nuclear waste, climate change, extinction of species. Benford was part of a team of artists and scientists trying to come up with ways of saying "WARNING" to humans (or other beings) in the distant future. <i>Deep Time</i> is a fascinating look at the nature of communication and the future implications of things we do today. It's a terrifically intelligent, detailed, and comprehensive long view, with a message sorely needed by short-lived, but brainy, humans. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p><p>Gregory Benford is a professor of physics at the University of California, Irvine.

And you can, too. Here in one volume are two classic works by Brother Lawrence. Each book reveals how to practice God's presence and see His glory in every facet of your life. <br><br><i>The Practice of the Presence of God </i>is a collection of documented conversations and letters that reveal the heart of this humble man. He wrote, "The time of business does not with me differ from the time of prayer, and in the noise and clatter of my kitchen . . . I possess God in as great tranquility as if I were upon my knees at the blessed sacrament." <br><br>Brother Lawrence's wisdom and spiritual insights have helped bring people closer to God for more than three centuries. <i>The Spiritual Maxims of Brother Lawrence, </i>a lesser known but equally outstanding work, is a summary of his teachings. Throughout, he develops one great theme, best expressed by the psalmist, "In Thy Presence is fulness of joy."Brother Lawrence is one of the most admired and imitated sons of the Catholic church. He worked for a time as a soldier before entering the Discalced Carmelite Prior in Paris. Lawrence was uneducated, and so had to enter the monastery as a layman. He worked in the kitchens and as a cobbler there for the remainder of his life. Lawrence is known for his devotion and ability to bring God into every aspect of his life. His classic Christian work, Practice of the Presence of God, details how to gain that constant and comforting connection to God. Readers have treasured this short and easy book for centuries because of Lawrence&#39;s honest advice and his obvious passion for spiritual matters. He rejoiced in everyday tasks, prayed constantly, and was known around the monastery for his kindness and willingness to help others. Practice of the Presence of God is a creative Christian work that is required reading according to many believers. Readers will come away with great peace and joy, and a better understanding of what it means to constantly be in God&#39;s presence.</p><h2>The Corruption of Capitalism: A strategy to rebalance the global economy and restore sustainable growth 1St edition by Richard Duncan (2009) Perfect Paperback</h2><p>The global economy is in crisis. The financial system has failed, international trade has contracted sharply and unemployment has soared. Only a multi-trillion dollar government intervention is preventing a worldwide breakdown on the scale of the Great Depression. In The Corruption of Capitalism, Richard Duncan provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of how this calamity came about. He also offers a strategy to permanently resolve it. The book is divided into three parts. Part I describes the present state of the global economy and the government life support keeping it afloat. Part II details the long series of US policy mistakes responsible for this disaster. Part III outlines the actions required to restructure the US economy and restore global economic growth. Capitalism has been corrupted by paper money and debt. Sustainable prosperity will require a return to economic orthodoxy. This book maps the way back.</p><p>Richard Duncan is the author of The Dollar Crisis: Causes, Consequences, Cures (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003), an international bestseller that predicted the current global economic disaster with extraordinary accuracy. This widely acclaimed book has been translated into five languages. It climbed to #17 on Amazon s list of all bestselling books worldwide in June 2003. The updated paperback edition (2005) rose to #10 on the Amazon list in October 2005, and ranked #56 as recently as December 2007. <br> Since beginning his career as an equities analyst in Hong Kong in 1986, Richard has served as global head of investment strategy at ABN AMRO Asset Management in London, worked as a financial sector specialist for the World Bank in Washington D.C., and headed equity research departments for James Capel Securities and Salomon Brothers in Bangkok. He also worked as a consultant for the IMF in Thailand during the Asia Crisis. He is now a partner at Blackhorse Asset Management in Singapore. <br> Richard has appeared frequently on CNBC, CNN, BBC and Bloomberg Television, as well as on BBC World Service Radio. He has published articles in The Financial Times, The Far East Economic Review, FinanceAsia and CFO Asia. He is also a well-known speaker whose audiences have included The World Economic Forum s East Asia Economic Summit in Singapore, The Euromoney Forex Forum in London, The Chief Financial Officers Roundtable in Shanghai, and The World Knowledge Forum in Seoul. <br> Richard studied literature and economics at Vanderbilt University (1983) and international finance at Babson College (1986); and, in between, spent a year backpacking around the world. <br> His literary goal is to write one bestselling book a year for then next 30 years.A lucid and original argument about the causes of financial instability, including the continuing global recession; the book lays out a bold agenda for structural reform, national and international.

This is a timely call for radical steps to rescue capitalism from financial and governmental follies. --Philip Bowring, International Herald Tribune<br><br>Richard Duncan makes the case in the highly readable Corruption of Capitalism that US dollar cash is losing its purchasing power at an accelerating rate against other assets because of the Fed s expansionary monetary policies. You can print money, you can increase the supply of bonds, you can increase the supply of equities through new issues, but you simply cannot increase the supply of gold and other precious metals at the same rate. <br> Richard Duncan demystifies in this highly readable book the belief that the Fed solves problems when in fact it is directly responsible for the present crisis. The Fed s irresponsible monetary policies have led to a de-industrialization of the US, a complete misallocation of capital, a colossal destruction of wealth of the median household and to a significant loss of the US dollar s purchasing power. Corruption of Capitalism is a must read in order to preserve your and your children s wealth. <br> Richard Duncan s Corruption of Capitalism is a well researched book, which shows how monetary policy errors leading to excessive credit growth brought about the current crisis. <br> Full of interesting figures and insightful comments, Richard Duncan s Corruption of Capitalism is an excellent read, which will greatly broaden investors knowledge and help protect their wealth --Dr Marc Faber, The Gloom, Boom &amp; Doom Report<br><br>An easy-to-read guide to understanding how and why the US response to its self-inflicted crisis addresses symptoms not causes.

Love, Marriage and Other Surprises<br><br>The wedding took place underneath the Castle, beneath that towering, formidable rock, in a quiet church that was reached from King&#x2019;s Stables Road. Matthew and Elspeth Harmony had made their way there together, in a marked departure from the normal routine in which the groom arrives first, to be followed by the bride, but only after a carefully timed delay, enough to make the more anxious members of her family look furtively at their watches &#x2013; and wonder. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Customs exist to be departed from, declared Matthew. He had pointedly declined to have a stag party with his friends but had nonetheless asked to be included in the hen party that had been organised for Elspeth. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Stag parties are dreadful,&#x201d; he pronounced. &#x201c;Everybody has too much to drink and the groom is subjected to all sorts of insults. Left without his trousers by the side of the canal and so on. I&#x2019;ve seen it.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not always,&#x201d; said Elspeth. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s up to you, Matthew.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was pleased that he was revealing himself not to be the type to enjoy a raucous male-only party. But this did not mean that Matthew should be allowed to come to her hen party, which was to consist of a dinner at Howie&#x2019;s restaurant in Bruntsfield, a sober do by comparison with the Bacchanalian scenes which some groups of young women seemed to go in for. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, new men might be new men, but they were still men, trapped in that role by simple biology. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Matthew,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that it&#x2019;s a good idea at all. The whole point about a hen party is that it&#x2019;s just for women. If a man were there it would change everything. The conversation would be different, for a start.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matthew wondered what it was that women talked about on such occasions. &#x201c;Different in what way?&#x201d; He did not intend to sound peevish, but he did. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Just different,&#x201d; said Elspeth airily. She looked at him with curiosity. &#x201c;You do realise, Matthew, that men and women talk about rather different things? You do realise that, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matthew thought of the conversations he had with his male friends. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if there&#x2019;s all that much difference,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I talk about the same things with my male and female friends. I don&#x2019;t make a distinction.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; said Elspeth. &#x201c;But the presence of a man would somehow interrupt the current. It&#x2019;s hard to say why, but it would.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the subject had been left there and Elspeth in due course enjoyed her hen party with seven of her close female friends, while Matthew went off by himself to the Cumberland Bar. There he met Angus Lordie sitting alone with his dog, Cyril. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I suppose that this is a sort of stag party for me,&#x201d; Matthew remarked to Angus. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Underneath the table, Cyril, who had long wrestled with temptation to bite Matthew&#x2019;s ankles, suddenly leaned forward and licked them instead. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There, you see,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;When a dog licks you, it confers a benediction. Cyril understands, you know. That&#x2019;s his way of saying that he&#x2019;s going to be sorry to lose you.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But he&#x2019;s not going to lose me,&#x201d; protested Matthew. &#x201c;One doesn&#x2019;t completely disappear when one gets married.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angus looked at Matthew with his slightly rheumy eyes. &#x201c;Really? Well, we won&#x2019;t be seeing much of you here after the event.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see,&#x201d; said Matthew. He raised his glass of beer to his lips and looked at Angus. Angus was much older than he was and was unmarried, which meant either that there was some profound reason &#x2013; lack of interest &#x2013; or that he had been successful in evading commitment. Now, which of these was it? <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What about yourself, Angus?&#x201d; Matthew asked. &#x201c;Have you ever thought of . . . tying the knot with anybody?&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angus smiled. &#x201c;Nobody would have me, I fear. Nothing would give me greater pleasure, I suspect, but, well, I&#x2019;ve never really got myself organised.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Of course, you&#x2019;d need to find somebody capable of taking on Cyril,&#x201d; said Matthew. &#x201c;And that wouldn&#x2019;t be easy.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angus shot Matthew an injured glance and Matthew immediately realised his tactlessness. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Cyril is a slight problem,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s difficult being canine, you see. Lots of women turn their noses up at dogs. Particularly with Cyril being the sort of dog that he is. You know, a wandering eye and some unresolved personal freshness issues. But I wish people would see beyond that.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matthew nodded. Angus would be a task enough for any woman, and to add Cyril to the equation made it even more of a burden. <br><br>&#x201c;What about Domenica?&#x201d; he asked suddenly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always thought that you and she might make a good couple.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angus looked wistfully at the ceiling. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve thought that too,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s much of a chance there. She can&#x2019;t abide Cyril, you see, and I can hardly get rid of him after all these years. His heart would break.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She&#x2019;d get used to him,&#x201d; said Matthew. &#x201c;And dogs don&#x2019;t last forever.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angus shook his head. &#x201c;No prospect,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But let&#x2019;s not talk about me and my problems. What about the wedding? I hear you&#x2019;ve got Charlie Robertson to do it for you. I knew him when he was at the Canongate Kirk. He does a nice line in weddings, and Her Majesty used to enjoy his sermons, I gather, when she was in residence at Holyrood. She must have had to listen to an awful lot of wheezy lectures from various archbishops of Canterbury &#x2013; it must have been so refreshing for her to get a good-going, no-nonsense sermon from somebody like Charlie. You know where you stand with the Church of Scotland, although as an Episcopalian, I must say there&#x2019;s a certain folksiness . . .&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We&#x2019;re making certain changes,&#x201d; said Matthew. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re walking up the aisle together. And we&#x2019;re having a reading from Kahlil Gibran. You know, The Prophet. There&#x2019;s a chapter there about love and commitment.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Angus began to let out an involuntary groan, but stopped himself. &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Yes. Kahlil Gibran. I see. And the honeymoon?&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matthew leaned forward and whispered. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t told Elspeth. It&#x2019;s going to be a surprise. Australia!&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angus looked into his glass. For some inexplicable reason, he felt a sense of foreboding, as if a sinister angel had passed overhead and briefly looked down upon them, as one of those lumbering heavy bombers, laden with high explosive, may spot a target below &#x2013; a quiet lane with lovers popular, the innocent going about their business, a farmer driving a truck along a winding lane; irresistible temptations for a sinister angel. <br><br>2. By the Side of the Bridal Path <br><br>Inside the church, three hundred guests &#x2013; and a handful of regular members of St. Cuthbert&#x2019;s, entitled in that capacity to attend any service &#x2013; sat waiting for the ceremony to begin. Matthew had told Elspeth that she should invite as many friends as she wished. His father was paying for the wedding and had imposed no limits; his own list, Matthew felt, was at risk of being embarrassingly small: a few old friends from school, his father and his new wife, a couple of distant cousins, Angus Lordie, Domenica Macdonald, Big Lou, James Holloway; that was about all. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Pat, Matthew&#x2019;s former girlfriend and occasional employee, had been invited too, and had accepted. Much to Matthew&#x2019;s relief it appeared that she bore no ill-will towards the woman who had supplanted her in Matthew&#x2019;s affections; and for her part, Elspeth, by nature, was not one to be jealous. Matthew had reassured her that although he had been serious about Pat, his seriousness had been a mistake; misplaced seriousness, as he described it. &#x201c;She was really more of a sister,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why I . . .&#x201d; He left the rest unsaid, and it was not referred to again. So many men might say &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why I . . .&#x201d; when talking about the carnal, reflected Elspeth; all men might, in fact. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Elspeth had invited everyone in her address book and many who were not. All her colleagues from the Steiner School were there, her suspension having been formally rescinded after the evidence of the other children &#x2013; prominent among them Tofu &#x2013; that Olive&#x2019;s account of the incident in which the teacher had pinched her ear was at the very least confused, and more likely mendacious. But by the time her reputation was cleared she had already resigned, become engaged, and decided not to go back to teaching. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>As well as Elspeth&#x2019;s former colleagues, an invitation had been given to all the children in the class she had taught. They were to attend under the supervision of their new teacher, who had led them into the church as a group and taken them to the pews reserved for them up at the top on the left. Here they sat &#x2013; Merlin, Pansy, Lakshmi, Tofu, Hiawatha and the rest, hair neatly combed, their legs swinging freely, not quite touching the floor, whispering to each other, awed by the solemnity of the occasion and the significance of what was about to happen to their beloved Miss Harmony. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll probably have a baby in a couple of weeks,&#x201d; said Olive knowingly. &#x201c;I hope it&#x2019;s a girl. It&#x2019;ll be a big tragedy if it&#x2019;s a boy.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Tofu turned and sneered at her from the pew in front. &#x201c;Babies take time,&#x201d; he said, adding, &#x201c;stupid.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&#x201c;What do you know about it?&#x201d; hissed Olive. &#x201c;And anyway, no girl would ever marry you. Not in a hundred years.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;You mean that nobody would ever marry you,&#x201d; retorted Tofu. &#x201c;They&#x2019;d take one look at you and be sick.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to marry Bertie,&#x201d; said Olive smugly. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s already asked me. We&#x2019;re going to get married when we&#x2019;re twenty. It&#x2019;s all settled.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Bertie, who was sitting a couple of places away from Olive heard this remark and froze. &#x201c;No, Olive, I didn&#x2019;t say I would,&#x201d; he protested. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;Olive glared at him. &#x201c;You did!&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You promised! Don&#x2019;t think you can break your promises like that.&#x201d; She snapped her fingers to demonstrate the speed of Bertie&#x2019;s broken promises, then looked at him and added, &#x201c;Especially in a church. God&#x2019;s really going to hate you, Bertie!&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>This conversation was interrupted by the organist, who began to play a Bach prelude. Although the congregation was unaware of their presence, Matthew and Elspeth had already arrived and were sitting with Charlie Robertson in the chapel at the back of the church, a small, tucked-away room on the walls of which the names of the fallen were inscribed in lead, equal in death, with no distinction of rank, just men. Matthew, feeling awkward, gazed at the lists of names and thought: they were my age, or younger. Some were seventeen or eighteen, and were only in France or wherever it was for a week or two, days in some cases, before they died in that landscape of explosion and whistling metal. They didn&#x2019;t have a chance, and now here am I, whose life has been so easy, reading about them and their sacrifice. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>It was as if Charlie Robertson had read Matthew&#x2019;s thoughts. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been very fortunate, haven&#x2019;t we?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Being born at the time we were.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Matthew glanced at Elspeth. He reached for her hand. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;On a more cheerful note,&#x201d; said Charlie. &#x201c;Did you know that it was in this chapel that Agatha Christie got married?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;Matthew showed his surprise. &#x201c;I would have thought that she would have been married in a sleepy little English village somewhere,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;In one of those places with an extraordinarily high murder rate.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Charlie laughed. &#x201c;I see what you mean,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But no. She got married here in Edinburgh. To her archaeologist husband. She said that an archaeologist was an ideal husband, as the older the wife became, the more interested he would be in her.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;Matthew smiled. It was difficult to imagine Agatha Christie as being young; some people were remembered as how they became, rather than how they were; it was something to with names, he thought. Agatha was not a young name. &#x201c;But didn&#x2019;t she run away?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;That was earlier,&#x201d; said Elspeth, who knew something about Agatha Christie. &#x201c;Her first, dashing husband fell in love with somebody else. So she disappeared, and was eventually found staying at a hotel in Harrogate.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;Charlie Robertson looked at his watch. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We should be thinking of starting. Are you two ready?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Matthew rose to his feet. Their conversation, innocent enough, had nevertheless made him think. In getting married, he realised, he was giving a hostage to fortune. By taking Elspeth into his life, the chances that the world would hurt him were doubled. She might leave him; she might run away, like Agatha Christie. There was so much that could go wrong in life if you took on somebody else, and then there were children and all the worries and anxiety they brought. There were so many reasons, he thought, for remaining single. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>He looked at Elspeth, who was adjusting the veil she had pinned to her hair. I don&#x2019;t want to hurt you, thought Matthew; that&#x2019;s the last thing I want. But should I really go through with this? Is it wise?</p><h2>Knowing One&#39;s Enemies: Intelligence Assessment Before the Two World Wars (Princeton Legacy Library, 744)</h2><p><p>In essays that illuminate not only the recent past but shortcomings in today's intelligence assessments, sixteen experts show how prospective antagonists appraised each other prior to the World Wars.

He was a painter before venturing into the world of film, and a painter's mentality permeates all his work, particularly his experiments in Super 8 film.<br><br> The Super 8s show Jarman at his most visually courageous and creative, using rich color and bold compositions, and experimenting with techniques such as superimposition and the use of prisms and filters. When Jarman died, he left his entire collection of ninety-two Super 8s to James Mackay, who has spent the last twenty years archiving, restoring, and digitizing them. Here, Mackay presents stills from these works, selected by artists and filmmakers who have engaged with or been influenced by Jarman. This remarkable body of work contains some of the most evocative images from the filmmaker&#x2019;s entire career, accompanied by insightful commentaries from contributors such as Gus Van Sant, Tacita Dean, and Isaac Julien. 780 illustrations</p><p>James Mackay studied art before becoming the cinema coordinator at the London Filmmakers&#39; Co-op.

I did not believe in ghosts, but I was visited by one. I could not deny it. When I least expected to, I would see my father, solid of body, curly of hair, in true corporeal splendor, even though he had died months earlier. Once I saw him across the floor at the Rose Room in the Algonquin Hotel. I spotted him from behind. He was dining with two other men, and his graying golden-brown hair looked as springy as ever. I made no attempt to speak to him. I sat in my seat, not eating my chef's salad, watching his familiar movements: the way he drank his martini, smoked his cigarette, gestured expansively. I guessed that he was trying to sell some land to his table companions. I had no doubt that he would pick up the tab.<br><br>The next time I saw him was at the apartment I shared with my sisters in Newport. It was a small, dingy, second-floor walkup, made cool by a breeze off the harbor. One close August morning Lily and Margaret had left for the boatyard where they worked, and I had just finished another cup of coffee. I grabbed an old Redbook and headed for the bathroom. There I found my father, seated on the toilet, reading the New York Daily News.<br><br>"Oh, I'm sorry," I said, backing out and slamming the door behind me.<br><br>"Hang on a sec, I'm almost through," he called. My heart was racing, but from embarrassment, not shock. I did not ask myself how my father, a man who had died wearing two colostomy bags, could be taking a normal shit. Nor did I wonder why he was reading the Daily News, a tabloid he had considered vulgar in life, and which, besides, was not readily available in Newport. I just sat at the kitchen table and waited.<br><br>Presently he flushed the toilet and opened the door. He wore a white dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up and a pair of faded madras shorts. Now that detail shocked me: he had pale, bony, freckled legs covered with curly reddish hair, and I had never seen him wear shorts.<br><br>"Sweetheart," he said, opening his arms to embrace me.<br><br>I raced toward him and gave him a huge hug. "Dad, are you real?" I asked, feeling queer for asking: he felt solid and sweaty.<br><br>"Yes, sweetheart, I am. Unfortunately, I can't stay long." He checked his watch, a cheap Bulova, the one he had worn ever since I could remember.<br><br>"Tell me everything. What has it been like?"<br><br>We sat opposite each other at the kitchen table. Lily's plastic birth-control Pilpac was open beside the pepper shaker, and I tried to surreptitiously glide it under a napkin. My father waved his hand.<br><br>"Don't bother doing that," he said. "I've seen it already. That's the sheer hell of it. I can see everything, the good along with the bad, and I can't tell you a damn thing about what to do."<br><br>Instantly my mind was flooded with images of things, the good along with the bad, that I had done since he had died. Alastair "Boom-Boom" Brady's face kept swimming to the forefront, and I kept blinking my eyes to push it away.<br><br>"That puke you're thinking of now, for instance. What is he, Australian?"<br><br>"Yes, he's a sailor. He's the bowman on a famous racer."<br><br>"I don't give a goddamn if he won the America's Cup, for godsakes. He's no good. You're a fine actress, even if it is for a soap opera. If you aren't going to have respect for yourself . . ." He patted his breast pocket and removed a pack of L&amp;Ms. He glanced around, and I handed him a matchbox from the Candy Store. Examining the logo, one gilded mermaid with two graceful tails, he lit his cigarette and handed the matchbox back to me. "And you should stay away from that place. The Candy Store. A bunch of guys with their hands in the cookie jar."<br><br>I fought to keep my mind blank. "Mom's good," I said.<br><br>"I know. I like the way she finished the living room. Tell her the beam's sagging, though. She'd better get a brace. In fact, have her call Creighton Albemarle--he owes me money. He'll do a good job."<br><br>"What do you mean, the beam's sagging? Is there any danger?" Just before my father died, he and my mother began renovating our summer cottage on Long Island Sound, converting the old screen porch into part of the living room, replacing the screens with huge Thermopane windows, removing the wall that had separated the porch from the living room, leaving one beam to bear the weight of the house. My mother lived alone there, year-round now, painting watercolors. My father's words frightened me; I thought I had noticed a slight bow myself.<br><br>"Nothing immediate, my angel. But have her take care of it before winter. I don't like the thought of snow on the roof."<br><br>"Dad, can I tell her I've seen you?"<br><br>He grinned then, a wide, easy grin that lifted his hazel eyes and made creases in his pale cheeks. He had a lean face and a long, straight nose. The Cavan nose. I had it myself. When I was young I once looked in a mirror and called my nose long. "Aristocratic," my father had corrected, only partly pretending to be angry.<br><br>"Telling people could be a problem, couldn't it?" he said now. "They'll wonder why I don't stay."<br>"Why don't you stay?" I asked.<br><br>His face went sad. My father's expression could run through emotions the way a flutist plays scales. "I just can't, Una," he said.<br><br>"But you'll come back?"<br><br>"If I can."<br><br>I stared at him, thinking that he needed another haircut. The day before he died, I had given him a bad haircut. He was lying in his hospital bed, weak and shrunken from cancer, and his thick, curly hair made his head itch. "They won't get me a barber," he had said. So I had picked up a pair of scissors, the crooked kind used by nurses to cut bandages, and chopped off all his hair. The remaining tufts sticking out on his skull, combined with his wide, darting eyes, had made him look like an owl.<br><br>"Whooo!" he said to me now. Then he rose, hugged me hard, and left through the front door.<br>I ran down Brewer Street to The Yard. Lily was making fast a long white ketch to a floating dock. Boom-Boom stood at the bow, a line in his heavy hands. He called my name, making it sound like "Ina" in his Australian accent, but I ignored him. "You have got to come with me," I said to Lily. "Where's Margo?"<br><br>She looked at me as if I were crazy. "I'm in the middle of something here."<br><br>"You've got to come now."<br><br>Lily gauged the situation. She knew I didn't often make demands unless they were urgent. Throwing the remaining untied line to Boom-Boom, she walked along the dock with me. We found Margaret driving the Travelift, a huge apparatus used for moving huge boats. "Margo!" Lily called. "Come on down."<br><br>Lily was our middle sister, two years younger than I, but she had seniority over Margaret at the boatyard as well as in our family. Margaret hurried across the hot asphalt parking lot, and we went into a ramshackle shed at the far end of The Yard.<br><br>"Una has big business," Lily explained.<br><br>"You won't believe this," I said. I remember twisting my hands, trying to find a clear way to tell them what had happened. I settled on directness. "I saw Dad."<br><br>"When?" Lily asked, her voice giving nothing away.<br><br>"Today--ten minutes ago. He looks great. He misses us all." I looked into both my sisters' faces. Lily's eyebrows were arched, her mouth thin and set. Margo ducked her head, patting the pockets of her khaki shorts for cigarettes. They both had wild yellow hair, unlike mine, which was reddish. The sun shined through the open windows behind them, lighting their heads like halos. I tried to breathe more steadily. "He was in the bathroom, reading the paper. I didn't buy the Daily News, and I know you two didn't, so how else would it be there? It's right on the floor, soaking wet because he dropped it on the bathmat." I gave Margo a dirty look because she was notorious for forgetting to hang up her wet bath things.<br><br>"Dad hates scandal sheets," Margo said.<br><br>"He used to, but apparently he likes them now."<br><br>"What did he say?" Lily asked.<br><br>"Okay. He said--" I laughed. "Typical. Guess what he said about Boom-Boom?"<br><br>" 'Stay away from that no-good punk,' " Lily said.<br><br>" 'Puke.' He said 'no-good puke.' "<br><br>"That is typical," Margo agreed.<br><br>"He also said that the Candy Store is bad, and also that Mom should get the beam fixed."<br><br>"No kidding. The house is ready to collapse," Lily said.<br><br>"What else?" Margo asked.<br><br>"That's about it. We just sat and talked."<br><br>I noticed, of course, the looks my sisters exchanged. I couldn't blame them for not truly believing me, no matter how badly I wanted them to; I hadn't told them about the time at the Algonquin for that precise reason. But this time seemed more compelling. Our father had appeared to me in their apartment.<br><br>"Listen," Lily said. "We'd better get back to work. You can finish telling us about it later."<br><br>I walked back up Brewer Street's small hill, disappointed that they hadn't felt more inclined to keep open minds. My day stretched emptily ahead, until five that evening, when they would come home. <br><br>All three of us were on leaves of sorts. They from Brown University, where they were both graduate students in the Art History Department, and I from my role as Delilah Grant on Beyond the Bridge, a soap opera that filmed five days a week, with occasional weeks off during which we were supposed to make public appearances at shopping malls and guest spots on game shows. But my character had disappeared for the summer. In September she would reappear, fleeing to Lake Huron, to an isolated cabin where she could forget a painful episode with her long-term lover, and where a psychopathic fur trapper would eventually corner her.<br><br>It had seemed like a perfect time to reunite with Lily and Margo. Our father had died in January; except for the two weeks surrounding his death when we had converged on our mother's house in Connecticut, we hadn't lived together for eight years. Presence is everything.<br><br>I used to say texture is everything, while Lily and Margo would say color is everything. We would have fantastic debates. Driving past the marsh at Black Hall, I would say the texture of the cattails and grasses, spiky and tubular, was the most beautiful. Margo and Lily would argue for the color: the shades of blue, green, and gold. (Although they preferred wilder colors with evocative names: apricot, persimmon, tea rose, vermilion, emerald, azure.) We invented names for our preferences. <br><br>The color school was Karsky (named for a boy Margo had known in high school) and the texture school was Schlumberger (pronounced shlum-bear-zhay, an extremely textural name).<br><br>Then we invented Vuarnet. Once when I went to Providence to visit them, we walked down Angell Street to the Rhode Island School of Design. The students there dressed like anarchists in black leather, skinny cotton shifts over black tights, white oxford-cloth shirts worn as dresses with studded leather belts, tight pedal pushers worn over plastic flip-flops. They had razor haircuts. They wanted to keep their skin pure white, so they wore sunscreen and walked on the shady side of the street. Margo and Lily told me the sunglasses they favored were Vuarnets and Ray-Bans, so we started calling that cool, new look "Vuarnet."<br><br>I remembered that day perfectly. They took me to the graduate student show at the RISD Museum. There were mammoth geometric paintings that resembled daggers on one wall; narrow, meticulously drawn architectural-type renderings which, when carefully regarded, showed men in lewd positions with each other; a video segment in which a TV screen was set into a doghouse and, when the viewer pressed the button, an image of feet pacing a room would appear on the screen and a whiny voice berating its father for neglect and mistreatment would blare out. One student had hired a crane to hoist a brand-new white Lincoln Continental into an interior courtyard, and that was his project. There were ceramic vases, enameled jewelry, furniture including a teak bed suspended from the ceiling in the midst of matching dining room table and chairs. Its title: Dining with the Invalid.<br><br>One student was walking through the show with his parents. Margo whispered to Lily and me that the father reminded her of a coal miner from West Virginia: he was brown and wizened, as if he spent much time underground, and he wore a thin, short-sleeved, green nylon shirt with a pack of Camels showing through the pocket. His posture was stooped. He walked around the gallery scowling while his wife, a proud fat woman, walked ahead with her son. "How do you like it, Willard?" she asked the man, and he said, "Too many doodads."<br><br>That cracked Margo up. She wanted to think of a school we could call "Doodad." We tried to connect it with Dada, but nothing sprang to mind. It seemed to overlap Vuarnet too much. On the way to their apartment, I stepped on a wad of gum. By the time I noticed it, it had stones, hair, and grass pressed into it. "My RISD thesis," I said. "Very Doodad."<br><br>"Vuarnet," Lily and Margo said at once.<br><br>Crossing the Brown Green, students recognized me from Beyond the Bridge. "Hey, Delilah," some of them called. Some of them just stared, but many asked whether I was planning to marry Beck Vandeweghe, my star-crossed lover and editor of the Mooreland Tribune. One girl asked for my autograph and said she had planned her entire spring semester around the show. I was used to such attention. I signed the autograph, secretly pleased that my sisters should see me adulated, but one thought nagged at my mind. <br><br>As Delilah, I had another family: my father, Paul Grant, and his scheming new wife Selena, my sisters Nicola, Stephanie, and Bianca, my half-brother Scott, and my illegitimate baby, Jennifer. But walking across the green that day, listening to people ask me about the Grants, I thought of my own father who had died two months earlier, and whose ghost I had seen the week before at the Algonquin. I was walking between my two real sisters, but that meant nothing to my fans.<br>At five-thirty, Lily and Margo came quietly into the apartment. They looked tired from working on the docks all day for the wages they stretched to cover their summer expenses. The sun, an orange ball over Newport Harbor, blazed through our west-facing windows. I was lying on the couch, with a smooth cotton sheet between me and the upholstery. Itchy wool upholstery.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Not Safe After Dark: And Other Stories (Inspector Banks)</h2><p><p>From the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Sleeping in the Ground</em> comes this brilliantly nuanced short story collection of twenty stories&#x2014;most never before published in the US, and one of them an Edgar winner&#x2014;which also features three Inspector Banks tales.</p><p>Peter Robinson pens thrilling tales rich with keen observations, pitch perfect dialogue, and shocking plot twists that have fascinated readers all over the world and made him one of the greatest suspense novelists alive.

Lawrence's "Seven Pillars of Wisdom" that was published for general circulation in 1935 was in fact an abridgement, prepared by Lawrence for the one-volume subscription edition he had issued in 1926. The abridgement was made from a fuller text he had completed, but not published, in 1922. At about 334,500 words, the 1922 text is a third longer than the published version. The 1922 text remained unpublished until 1997, when Jeremy Wilson assisted by Richard Westwood edited a "best text" from the two surviving sources. One of these was Lawrence's manuscript in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. The other was his personal annotated copy of an uncorrected 8-copy proof-printing made in 1922 at the 'Oxford Times' printing works (Lawrence had found this cheaper than having eight copies typed). Th edited "best text" was published by Castle Hill Press in 1997 as "Seven Pillars of Wisdom, The Complete 1922 Text". In 2003/4 it was reissued in private and trade editions. For these the text was rechecked and slightly revised. Hazel H. Bell contributed a scholarly 49-page index, which went on to win the Wheatley Medal. This 2014 paperback edition uses the same typesetting as the 2003/4 one-volume editions, but there have been a number of amendments to the text and index. These arose largely from geographical research by the translators of the Japanese edition. Contemporaries such as E.M. Forster and Robert Graves who read both the Oxford Times proof-printing and the 1926 subscribers abridgement preferred the former, since the writing-style is easier and more natural. It unquestionably the more important text for anyone interested in the history of the Arab Revolt or in Lawrence's biography. For the sake of readability, no attempt has been made to to cram this huge text into a single volume. The page format and type size is the same as it was in the 2003/4 hardbacks. Jeremy Wilson has written a new foreword for this edition, and Lawrence's wartime 'Twenty-seven Articles' have been added as an appendix.</p><p>T. E. Lawrence, &#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34; became famous for his role as a British Liaison Officer with the guerrilla Arab Forces during the Arab Revolt of 1916-18. &#39;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&#39;, his account of his experiences in the Revolt, became a world classic. He also made one of the most successful translations of Homer&#39;s &#39;Odyssey&#39;, which has remained continuously in print since 1932.</p><h2>What&#39;s Wrong with My Plant?: Expert Information at Your Fingertips Pests * Diseases * Common Problems</h2><p>Whatever the problem, from slugs and bugs to molds, rots, and wilts, here is expert guidance in diagnosing pests and diseases and dealing with them quickly and effectively.

Eliza Lucas Pinckney was a child prodigy turned celebrity.&nbsp; Her remarkable success in the eighteenth-century colonial world is a noteworthy achievement that required skill, luck and a strong personality.&nbsp; The fact that she did this while working within the enormous social constraints faced by women make her even more remarkable.<br><br>As a girl, Eliza managed to run three plantations, supervise a household of servants and care for her invalid mother and younger sister.&nbsp; Yet by age seventeen she had already achieved what others deemed impossible--successfully cultivating indigo and producing its blue dye.<br><br> During my research I discovered that many details of Eliza Lucas Pinckney's life were available in her letters and journals, which had been saved from burning by her great-granddaughter, Eliza Lucas Rutledge.&nbsp; Sadly, any likeness or portrait of her most probably had been destroyed, either in the pillaging of her Belmont Plantation house or in the 1861 fire that destroyed the Pinckney's Charleston <i>Mansion House. </i><br><i><br> </i>Harriott Horry Ravenel's 1896 book <i>Eliza Pinckney</i> reproduced many of Eliza's letters and journals.&nbsp; <i>&nbsp;</i>These became the guidelines to better understand the essence of my protagonist.&nbsp; Some of them are quoted directly in my story, with a few alterations in the selection of words and spelling to make them better suited for modern readers.<br><br> I have attempted to use "British spelling and colloquialisms" when possible.&nbsp; I also extracted dialogue from my remarkable research resources. Most of the dialogue throughout the story was of course invented.&nbsp; I have also referenced scholarly journals, books, magazines, newspapers and historical documents in my effort to capture this articulate, observant and highly-intelligent woman's life.<br> I attempt to write into the emotional center of my work--to always be available, vulnerable and truthful. Because my genre is <i>historical novel</i>, I owe the reader forthrightness and honesty.&nbsp; In full disclosure, I want to point out the fictional characters in the book.&nbsp; <i>Cameron Schiller</i> was invented to represent the many suitors Eliza must have had whose names have not been recorded.&nbsp; The Charles Town factor was an important character in her story, but I was unable to discover his real name, so in the story he became <i>Mr.</i> <i>Dawson</i>. <i>Tabitha and Gelasius,</i> her childhood servants from the West Indies, are fictional characters, as are her Antiguan friends, <i>Nelly, Patty </i>and<i> Benjamin.</i>&nbsp; All the other characters, central and marginal, including the scoundrel Nicholas Cromwell, were real people in Eliza's life.&nbsp; The events are factual, including the journeys, battles and historical happenings.<br> <br>As with my Mary Musgrove novel, <i>An Angry Drum Echoed</i>, I came to understood Eliza so well from immersing myself in her story that I became one with her.&nbsp; Obviously, there is a great portion of myself in Eliza's nature.&nbsp; She was also sculpted from attributes and traits of my two daughters, Cassandra Coveney and Ticiana Gordillo, as were her daughter Harriott and her sister Polly.&nbsp; Hopefully, my girls will see features of themselves throughout Eliza's story.<br> <br>Eliza Lucas Pinckney knew when to assert herself and when to be properly submissive.&nbsp; Like Mary Musgrove, her story is a legend that has left a vivid imprint on colonial southern history.<br>&nbsp; <br> Her life story is my offering to you.&nbsp; In honoring the commitment to write it, I have been blessed and gifted by my Creator.Pamela Bauer Mueller was raised in Oregon.&nbsp; She has worked as a flight attendant, commercial model and actress, an English and Spanish teacher and a U.S. Customs Inspector.&nbsp; She now lives on Jekyll Island Georgia with her husband Michael and their cats Sukey Spice and Morgan Maurice. <br><br>Pamela's children and young adult books have awarded her the <i><b>2006/2008 </b></i>and the <i><b>2009 Georgia Author of the Year </b></i>titles, three <i><b>Mom's Choice </b></i>and <i><b>Children's Choice </b></i>gold medals, the <i><b>Independent Publisher Gold Book </b></i>awards and other national awards with <b><i>Writer's Digest </i></b>and <i><b>ForeWord</b> </i>magazines.

She asks the question - what does it mean to be a woman working within the predominantly male genre of expressionist art? The artist often chooses women, children and infants as her subject matter, examining the relation between art and female beauty. The authors then analyze Dumas&#39;s work, with subjects such as: the development of Dumas&#39;s work in relation to the legacies of European painting; questions contemporary women artists are asked; and a look at the artist&#39;s painting &#34;Josephine&#34;, reflecting on the iconic legacy of Josephine Baker. The book also features selections from Dumas&#39;s writings, including texts on her own work, meditations on love, religion and politics, and a discussion of Goya&#39;s painting &#34;The Fates&#34;. The book is part of a series of studies of important artists of the late-20th century. Each title offers a comprehensive survey of the artist&#39;s work, providing analyses and multiple perspectives on contemporary art and its inspiration.</p><p>Dominic van den Boogerd is a writer on contemporary art.

Huysmans&#x2019; art criticism reveals the author of Against Nature to be as combative in his aesthetic opinions as he was in his literary ones. At a time when the Impressionists were still being ridiculed, or worse still ignored, Huysmans defiantly proclaimed Degas to be the best painter in France. He filled his pages with analyses of the works of artists whose genius and popularity have been confirmed by time: Gustave Caillebotte, Paul Gauguin, Mary Cassatt, Edouard Manet, Berthe Morisot, Odilon Redon and Gustave Moreau.<br><br>Huysmans intersperses his reviews of these independent artists with those of the annual Official Salon, whose conventional and dryly academic works he lambasts with his customary gusto and invective.<br><br>This is the first complete translation of L&#x2019;Art moderne, and includes 200 black and white illustrations, notes and a glossary of artists.</p><p>J.-K. Huysmans (1847-1907) changed from being an obscure author and art critic to one of the most famous authors of his day with the publication of A Rebours (Against Nature) in 1884. A Rebours is a ground-breaking novel which captures the decadent spirit of the day and marks his final break with Zola and naturalism. Dedalus have published 11 books by J.-K. Huysmans, 9 in new translations by Brendan King; Marthe, Parisian Sketches, The Vatard Sisters, Stranded (En Rade), Drifting, Against Nature, Las Bas, Modern Art and The Cathedral.

Degas who I&#x2019;ve saved until last &#x2013; to say a few words about the two female painters of the group: Mlle. Cassatt and Mme. Berthe Morisot.<br><br>A student of Degas &#x2013; I see his influence in that charming painting in which the back of a redheaded woman, dressed in yellow, is reflected in a mirror on the crimson backdrop of a theatre box &#x2013; Mlle. Cassatt is clearly also a student of the English painters, because her excellent canvas, two ladies taking tea in an interior, makes me think of certain works exhibited in 1878, in the English section of the Exposition Universelle.<br><br>Here, we&#x2019;re still with the middle class, but it&#x2019;s not that of M. Caillebotte; it&#x2019;s a world that&#x2019;s equally comfortably off, but more refined, more elegant. In spite of her personality, which still hasn&#x2019;t completely emerged yet, Mlle. Cassatt nevertheless has a curious quality that is especially attractive, because there&#x2019;s a frisson of nervous female tension in her painting that is more balanced, more tranquil, more intelligent than that of Mme. Morisot, a student of M. Manet.<br><br>Left in the unfinished state of sketches, the works exhibited by this artist are a chic jumble of white and pink. They&#x2019;re like Manet-esque Chaplins, with the turbulence of nervous agitation and strain added in. The women Mme. Morisot shows us at their toilette smell of &#x2018;New Mown Hay&#x2019;25 and frangipani; one divines silk stockings beneath their dresses, which seem to be designed by dressmakers of renown. A heady, fashionable elegance escapes from these morbid sketches, these astonishing improvisations, which might justly, perhaps, be qualified by the epithet &#x2018;hysterical&#x2019;.<br><br>I now pass in front of the soft, whitish painting by Mme. Bracquemond, in front also of the portrait of Edmond de Goncourt executed by M. Bracquemond, a portrait done ï¿½ la Holbein though of an excessive harshness in the flesh, especially the pores which are like the grain in marble, but an interesting portrait nevertheless because it captures the writer at home in the middle of his collection of precious objets d&#x2019;art; and, neglecting a series of etchings on fine China paper destined to decorate a set of dinner plates, intriguing, it&#x2019;s true, but taken almost wholly from the sketchbooks of Hokusai, I finally stop in the room in which the canvases by Degas shine out.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t remember ever having experienced a shock similar to that I felt.</p><h2>Chaucerian Dream Visons and Complaints (Middle English Texts)</h2><p>On several counts, one particular collection of French lyrics made in France in the late fourteenth century, University of Pennsylvania MS 15, is the most likely repository of Chaucer&#39;s French poems. It is the largest manuscript anthology extant of fourteenth-century French lyrics in the formes fixes (balade, rondeaux, virelay, lay, and five-stanza chanson) with by far the largest number of works of unknown authorship. The known authors represented in the manuscript and the texts themselves have notable associations with England and with Chaucer. And intriguingly there are fifteen lyrics each headed by the initials Ch, very likely indications of authorship, neatly inserted between rubric and text. . . .

The scribes of ancient Israel are indeed the main figures behind the Hebrew Bible, and in this book Karel van der Toorn tells their story for the first time. His book considers the Bible in very specific historical terms, as the output of the scribal workshop of the Second Temple active in the period 500-200 BCE. Drawing comparisons with the scribal practices of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, van der Toorn clearly details the methods, the assumptions, and the material means of production that gave rise to biblical texts; then he brings his observations to bear on two important texts, Deuteronomy and Jeremiah. </p><p> Traditionally seen as the copycats of antiquity, the scribes emerge here as the literate elite who held the key to the production as well as the transmission of texts. Van der Toorn's account of scribal culture opens a new perspective on the origins of the Hebrew Bible, revealing how the individual books of the Bible and the authors associated with them were products of the social and intellectual world of the scribes. By taking us inside that world, this book yields a new and arresting appreciation of the Hebrew Scriptures. </p></p><p><p>Karel van der Toorn is President of the University of Amsterdam.<br></p>Every decade we see the publication of only one or two works of scholarly excellence that fundamentally advance the understanding of the Hebrew Bible and change the intellectual contours of the biblical field. Karel van der Toorn has accomplished this rarest of intellectual achievements. Different branches of biblical studies, whether literary, theological or historical in orientation, will strongly benefit from this volume.<br> --Mark S. Smith, Skirball Professor of Bible and Ancient Near Eastern Studies, New York University<br><br>Van der Toorn has made a masterful case that the Hebrew Bible is the product of the scribal culture of ancient Israel and Judaism. His argument is lucidly and elegantly plotted and relentlessly and convincingly logical. Particularly striking is his ability to bring evidence from other ancient Near Eastern cultures on the scribal craft, especially Mesopotamia, to a penetrating and nuanced elucidation of the Biblical case. In all, this is really a major contribution to Biblical studies and a triumph of the comparative approach to them.<br> --Peter Machinist, Hancock Professor of Hebrew and Other Oriental Languages, Harvard University<br><br>Karel van der Toorn has truly swept away a number of improbable theories and at the same time has laid a firm foundation for future research. He cuts through much of the speculation of the recent scholarly debate and proposes new theories that will be controversial but are based on solid evidence. Future debates on this topic will need to take his contributions into account or risk being perceived to be out of touch with the reality of ancient literary practice.<br> --Robert R. Wilson, Hoober Professor of Religious Studies and Professor of Old Testament, Yale University<br><br>This scrupulous study by the Dutch scholar Karel van der Toorn of how the Hebrew Bible was written and then evolved over time is in most respects finely instructive. Some of what Toorn has to say involves concepts long familiar to Biblical scholars, though even in this regard he provides many fresh insights. Nearly all the book's argument, moreover, offers a strong corrective to misconceptions about the Bible...Karel van der Toorn is the perfect--and bracing--antithesis to Harold Bloom...<i>Scribal Culture and the Making of the Hebrew Bible</i> is a salutary book based on the most formidable scholarly knowledge and analysis. It will compel readers to rethink their conceptions of literary production in ancient Israel, and it is a valuable reminder that in many respects those responsible for the biblical corpus were quite far from being early Iron Age equivalents of Flaubert or Henry James.<br> --Robert Alter (<i>London Review of Books</i> 2007-07-19)<br><br>Building upon the growing recognition that the Hebrew Bible came into being as the Near East moved from an oral to a written culture...Van der Toorn...examines the central role ancient scribes played in shaping the biblical text. The author brings to bear his vast knowledge of scribal practices throughout the ancient Near East, and thereby shows how the Bible&#x2019;s growth is illuminated when seen against this background. While at times speculative (e.g., his contention that Deuteronomy passed through four editions, which he neatly delineates), the author&#x2019;s research calls into question those who blithely dismiss source and redaction criticism; it also challenges the conclusions of historical minimalists who date the vast bulk of the Hebrew Bible to late in the Persian or early in the Hellenistic era. Furthermore, the portrait Van der Toorn draws of scribal training deals a devastating blow to critics who argue that J may have been a woman. Van der Toorn demonstrates that the scribes who produced the Hebrew Bible were part of a wider scribal culture and that those who ignore this fact end up misunderstanding the biblical text and its history.<br> --J.S. Kaminsky (<i>Choice</i> 2007-09-01)<br><br>Van der Toorn covers considerable ground in this volume. He surveys literacy and authorship in the ancient world, the culture and vocation of scribes, production of the Moses and prophetic traditions, and the issues of revelation and canon...This volume is extremely valuable. <i>Scribal Culture</i> is a must-read for anyone interested in the issues of the formation, transmission, and standardization of the Hebrew Bible.<br> --Charles Halton (<i>Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society</i> 2007-12-01)</p><h2>Cook Yourself Happy: The Danish Way</h2><p>Add some hygge to your life and learn to cook Danish style with this beautifully illustrated cookbook containing over 100 delicious Danish recipes.<br> Promoting the very best of Danish cuisine, this is a mouth-watering selection of authentic, traditional Danish recipes, which have been handed down through the generations.<br> This wealth of recipes covers every meal and occasion &#x2013; whether a light lunch of Warm Smoked Salmon with Pickled Cucumber, the heartier national dish of Stegt Flaesk (fried pork belly) or Pheasant Ragout, a delightful dessert of Baked Apples with Marzipan and Raisins, the most traditional of Danish pastries, or a wonderful Hot Chocolate with Orange Syrup, Cook Yourself Happy is filled with enriching food that your friends and family will adore.<br> The concept of &#x2018;hygge&#x2019;, which plays a big part in Danish cuisine, is embedded in this cookbook in recipes that will boost your sense of wellbeing both inside and out.<br><br> Food, family and Denmark are Caroline&#x2019;s first loves, and this is&nbsp;echoed in the book with photographs of Caroline cooking at home, interspersed with gorgeous photographs of her family home in Denmark.&nbsp;<br> ï¿½??Drawing on traditional age-old family recipes, this beautifully illustrated cookbook focuses on the most delicious and nourishing traditional Danish recipes that will boost your sense of wellbeing both inside and out.</p><p><p>Caroline Fleming has earned a reputation as a lifestyle guru.

In "The Sedgemoor Strangler," a serial killer leaves a naked corpse among the reeds, and a young waitress gradually comes to suspect that she is the next victim. Another serial killer terrifies a nineteenth-century housewife in the shocking, twisting tale of "Dr Death." Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson investigate the stealing of the Christmas Star in "The Four Wise Men." "The Amorous Corpse" is one of the finest recent impossible crime detective stories &#x2014; a robbery is committed by a man proven by unimpeachable evidence to have been dead several hours earlier. In "The Problem of Stateroom 10," the famous mystery writer Jacques Futrelle investigates a murder as the Titanic goes down. <p>Full of wit, irony, tricky plots, and an engaging sense of place and time, The Sedgemoor Strangler is an extraordinary collection of sixteen extraordinary stories.</p></p><p>Peter Lovesey has won honors around the world, including the Gold and Silver Daggers, the Macavity, and the Grand Prix de Litterateur Policiï¿½re. The British Crime Writers Association has recognized Lovesey with its highest honor, the Cartier Diamond Dagger for Lifetime Achievement.Short-story aficionados should flock to this marvelous collection of 16 nail-bitingly suspenseful tales from the popular British crime writer. Perfect murders, serial stranglers, mysterious paintings, deadly practical jokes, gorilla suits--they're all here. It's been said that writing short mystery fiction is tougher than writing mystery novels (not enough room for characters to develop, the argument goes), but Lovesey makes it look like a walk in the park. He even makes his "gimmick" stories--a Sherlock Holmes pastiche, a murder mystery set on the <i>Titanic,</i> a tale in which a dead man appears to have committed a robbery--look effortless, a trick many writers have yet to master. These stories have appeared in such magazines and anthologies as <i>Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine</i>, <i>The Strand</i>, and <i>Death by Horoscope,</i> but even those who have read them all before will want to read them again.

Historically, James, Duke of Monmouth and the eldest known illegitimate child of Charles II, led an unsuccessful uprising against his uncle, the Catholic James II, in 1685. He was beheaded and his followers and supporters executed. In Norton and Edgehill's universe, Charles II married Monmouth's mother secretly before becoming king and making a childless state marriage. Upon Charles's death, Monmouth was crowned Charles III, continuing a Protestant Stuart line on England's throne.</p><p> It is now 1807. The demon-worshipping Duc d'Charenton, who's known as Marquis de Sade in our world, is conjuring black magic. Though he serves Emperor Napoleon through French spymaster Talleyrand, de Sade plots to find the Holy Grail, exult Satan, and destroy the only remaining member of France's royal family, the dauphin Louis Capet. Louis escaped France aided by the Duke of Wessex, Rupert St. Ives Dyer, an agent for England's intelligence service. He got to Baltimore, New Albion (England's North American Colonies, since no American Revolution occurred) with his wife, Meriel, and then disappeared.</p><p> Meriel writes to Sarah, Duchess of Wessex, to beg for help. Sarah, originally from Baltimore in our universe, decides to go to Meriel's aid and see New Albion. Wessex, returning from an urgent mission, follows his wife. Unfortunately, de Sade has been named governor of French Louisianne (no Louisiana Purchase occurred here) and is on his way. All will meet in Nouvelle Orl eï¿½ans.</p><p> Readers who admired J.

Colts, 1958, and the Birth of the Modern NFL</h2><p>On December 28, 1958, the New York Giants and Baltimore Colts met under the lights of Yankee Stadium for that season's NFL Championship game. Football, growing in popularity amid America's post-war economic boom, was still greatly overshadowed by the country's favored pastime - baseball - but the 1958 championship proved to be the turning point for pro football. In The Best Game Ever, Mark Bowden delivers a brilliant narrative on the 1958 NFL Championship game, the story behind the key players, and the effect the contest had on the modern game of football and today's NFL.<br>Played on a freezing Sunday evening in front of 64,000 fans and millions of television viewers around the country, the championship would go down as the greatest in football history. On the field and roaming the sidelines were seventeen future Hall of Famers, including Colts stars Johnny Unitas, Raymond Berry, and Gino Marchetti, and Giants greats Frank Gifford, Sam Huff, and assistant coaches Vince Lombardi and Tom Landry. The championship was a battle of the league's best offense - the Colts - versus its best defense - the Giants. It squared the blue-collar Baltimore team, many of whom worked off-season jobs selling liquor or taking shifts at Bethlehem Steel, against the glamour boys of the Giants squad who often appeared in TV commercials and were seen around town at trendy spots like Toots Shor's mingling with the likes of politicians and Broadway stars.<br>An estimated forty-five million viewers - at that time the largest crowd to have ever watched a football game - tuned in to see what would become the first sudden-death contest in NFL history. The Colts led at halftime, 14-3, but a courageous goal-line stand by the Giants in the beginning of the third quarter fueled a second-half comeback. The Giants took a three-point lead in the fourth quarter on a Frank Gifford touchdown. With two minutes left in regulation, Baltimore had possession deep in its own territory, and the ball in the hands of the still unproven quarterback Johnny Unitas.<br>The Best Game Ever is a brilliant portrait of how a single game changed the history of American sports. Published to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the championship, it is destined to be a sports classic.</p><p>Entertaining and informative narration . . .

Both of us were divorced. In addition, we each had two children, were passionate about psychology, and loved BBQ. We even had the exact same idea of our ideal vacation: driving around the United States in a rented RV with our newly blended family. Imagine how compatible we (thought we) were!<br><br>I can&#x2019;t remember a single thing we disagreed on.<br><br>Ahhh, the splendor of a newly budding relationship!<br><br>One minute you&#x2019;re involved in your life as you know it, when suddenly you see the one. Your eyes meet (perhaps across a crowded room). Heart palpitations start. And the fairy tale of romance begins. Flowers, batting eyelashes, shared meals, laughter. Sunset walks and little love gifts to each other. You spend hours looking forward to your next time together. Maybe you&#x2019;ll see a movie or simply hang out--talking about everything and nothing.<br><br>Each of you finds yourself saying: &#x201c;It feels like I&#x2019;ve known you forever. . . .&#x201d; And in some ways you have. This new person has some very strong similarities to your childhood caregivers.<br><br>Now this &#x201c;falling in love&#x201d; business might not be so intense for everyone. For some, it&#x2019;s more gradual. But either way, you begin to think about each other a lot. Being apart feels unbearable. So you text and call each other frequently. When together, you seem to know each other&#x2019;s thoughts. You complete each other&#x2019;s sentences. You know exactly what the other one wants because, well, it&#x2019;s exactly what you want too!<br><br>The early stage of a romance brings out the best in people. Both homes are always tidy. Personal grooming is done with special care. Neither one of you burps around the other person. Before you even know what&#x2019;s happening, you&#x2019;ve fallen head over heels in LOVE.<br><br>Romantic Love that is . . .<br><br>It is a mysterious attraction: you feel moments of absolute ecstasy!<br><br>Unfortunately this bliss doesn&#x2019;t last.<br>FROM ECSTASY TO AGONY<br><br>Romantic Love sticks around long enough to bind two people together. Then it rides off into the sunset. And seemingly overnight, your dream marriage can turn into your biggest nightmare.<br><br>Now, once in the throes of full-blown Romantic Love, you can do no wrong. When Romantic Love fades however, it feels like you can do no right. The person who was once your greatest fan can become your worst critic. Adoration is replaced by nagging. You notice yourself thinking, &#x201c;Who IS this person I married? We used to be so compatible. We agreed on everything.&#x201d; The pit of your stomach churns. And you ask yourself, &#x201c;How can my partner think that way, act that way, say those things? They fooled me into believing they were someone else!&#x201d;<br><br>When rudely awakened from the dazzling dream of compatibility, people can get very grumpy. Desperate to end the pain and disappointment Romantic Love leaves behind, many couples get divorced. Others who decide not to do the mind--numbing work of dividing up the stuff may stay together. But they wind up living parallel lives, without any true connection. They assume this is as good as it gets. But secretly they think something must be terribly wrong.<br><br>Let us reassure you, nothing has gone wrong.<br><br>Romantic Love is just the first stage of couplehood. It&#x2019;s supposed to fade.<br><br>Romantic Love is the powerful force that draws you to someone who has the positive and negative qualities of your parents or caregiver (this includes anyone responsible for your care as a child, for example: a parent, older sibling, grandparent, or babysitters.). You felt like you knew your partner forever when you first met because they have the positive qualities of your parents. And because they also have your parents&#x2019; negative qualities, you wind up feeling irritated and disappointed by your partner. This is why agony can replace the initial ecstasy. Why relationships can get so painful and hard.<br><br>Whoa! The idea that your partner is really a composite of your parents can be a bit upsetting at first. Though we love our parents, most of us got over (consciously) wanting to marry them when we turned five or six. Then, when we hit our teenage years, all we wanted was our freedom. But the fact is, we&#x2019;re unconsciously drawn to that special someone with the best and worst character traits of all of our caregivers combined. We call this our &#x201c;Imago&#x201d;---the template of positive and negative qualities of your primary caregivers.<br><br>If you&#x2019;re reading this and thinking, &#x201c;But wait, there is no resemblance between my partner and my parents,&#x201d; let us clarify: Your partner may not look like your parents, and on the surface they may not act like your parents. But you will end up feeling the same feelings you had as a child when you were with your parents. This includes the sense of belonging and the love you felt. But it also includes the experience and upset of not getting all your needs met.<br>RELIVING CHILDHOOD<br><br>We call the result of not getting all of your needs met your &#x201c;childhood wounding.&#x201d; You become sensitive in the present to what was missing in the past. Our unconscious mind is set up so that the only way to heal these wounds is to have someone with traits like our caregivers learn how to give us what we needed--and missed out on--in childhood. Though frustrating to endure, this design of relationship has a wondrous plan: to heal each other&#x2019;s childhood wounds.<br><br>Rest assured that when we talk about childhood wounding, we&#x2019;re not blaming anyone&#x2019;s parents (ours or yours). The reality is that nobody&#x2019;s parents were perfect. Ask any one of our six kids if we were perfect, and they will assure you we&#x2019;re certainly not! But even when parents are great, there are ways their parenting misses the mark. In other words, it&#x2019;s impossible to parent &#x201c;perfectly.&#x201d;<br><br>So whether your parents were lousy, or if their wounding was more subtle, the results generally fall into two categories. Your parents were either overinvolved, which left you feeling controlled and smothered.<br><br>Or your parents were underinvolved, which left you feeling abandoned.<br><br>As a young girl, I felt smothered by the expectations of others. My parents required me to be sweet and thoughtful to everyone, no matter how I really felt. Born and raised in the South, my whole culture expected me to be a gracious Southern Belle who pleased others. I was even taught how to execute a perfect curtsey--seriously, I was expected to bow to others. Busy volunteering at the hospital, my mother was rarely around when I got home from school. And, like her, I was expected to volunteer the majority of my free time.<br><br>Now fast-forward to my marriage.<br><br>You&#x2019;d think I&#x2019;d be the perfect wife, caring for Harville in every way. . . .<br><br>Well, the truth is yes . . . and no.<br><br>When we got married, I vowed to be the best wife I could be to Harville. Utterly devoted, I prided myself on paying attention to all the details of his life--every single one of them. Pretty soon, I felt like I knew him better than he knew himself. (Oh dear, watch out!)<br><br>When friends asked Harville a question, I&#x2019;d often proudly jump in and answer. I&#x2019;d set out his breakfast and pridefully cook dinner for him without asking what he wanted. I didn&#x2019;t have to ask. Because I already knew. Given his love of Star Trek, I just knew he&#x2019;d be delighted with the Star Trek mugs and bath towels I surprised him with from time to time. I was so attentive to Harville that if you wanted to know how he was doing, all you had to do was ask me.<br><br>Given all I was doing for him, I assumed he felt so lucky to be married to me. Then one day, Harville did something SO completely out of character. He SNAPPED! I&#x2019;d never seen him so angry. I was shocked. Hurt. And so confused. How could he not appreciate all that I was doing? After he calmed down, he explained that in all my efforts, I&#x2019;d never actually asked him what he wanted. This was stunning feedback. I&#x2019;d assumed I already knew, but instead Harville felt utterly eradicated.<br><br>In spite of my many efforts, I was failing to meet any of Harville&#x2019;s real needs. I was doing things for him, but I wasn&#x2019;t connecting with him.<br><br>The patterns from my childhood wounding fit perfectly with Harville&#x2019;s. Both of Harville&#x2019;s parents died when he was young and he was sent to live with his older sister, Rosa Lee, when he was six. She tried to do everything she could for him. And she was great in many ways. But she had other children to care for. And she was his older sister. So she wasn&#x2019;t as attuned to Harville as his mother had been. How could she be? As a result, Harville felt very lonely. His primary childhood wounding was abandonment.<br><br>My doing things for Harville without really being connected with him brought up these same childhood feelings. Once again he was being abandoned, but this time by his wife.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t a mistake that our childhood wounding fit together so well. Remember, when Romantic Love strikes, you will be drawn to a person whose behaviors make you re-experience the feelings you had with your caregivers.<br><br>So remember, your unconscious mind chose your partner. It knew that in order to heal your childhood wounds, you had to feel these emotions again as an adult. Marriage gives you this chance to relive memories and feelings from your childhood, but with a different, happier outcome. As a child you were helpless. As an adult, you have power. You can work with your partner so that each of you gets your needs met.<br>BUT HERE&#x2019;S SOME GOOD NEWS<br><br>All this may seem like a terrible tangle. But since partnership is designed to resurface feelings from childhood, it means that most of the upset that gets triggered in us during our relationship is from our past. Yes! About 90 percent of the frustrations your partner has with you are really about their issues from childhood. That means only 10 percent or so is about each of you right now. Doesn&#x2019;t that make you feel better?<br>MYSTERY DECODED!<br><br>Romantic Love delivers us into the passionate arms of someone who will ultimately trigger the same frustrations we had with our parents, but for the best possible reason! Doing so brings our childhood wounds to the surface so they can be healed.<br><br>You&#x2019;d think that with this potential for healing, your relationship would get a whole lot better in a hurry. And eventually it will get a whole lot better.<br><br>But there&#x2019;s some challenging work to be done first.<br>Truth #1: Romantic Love Is a Trick<br><br>EXERCISE: THEN AND NOW<br><br>First:<br><br>1. Write down the frustrations you remember that you had with your childhood caregivers and how you felt (you can use &#x201c;Frustrations Then and Now&#x201d; on page 157, which is part of the exercise program at the back of the book). The frustrations can be a specific event or a general experience.<br><br>Reminder: Caregivers include whoever was responsible for your care when you were a child, for example, a parent, older sibling, relative, or babysitter.<br><br>2. List the ongoing frustrations you have with your partner and how these make you feel. List as many as you can--including both petty annoyances and those things that really irritate you.<br><br>3. Look over the two lists, noting any similarities.<br><br>Then:<br><br>Talk over the similarities between the two lists with your partner. As you share, you&#x2019;ll notice the curiosity growing between you. It&#x2019;s hard to feel curious and frustrated at the same time. In the exercise for Truth #7 (Negativity Is a Wish in Disguise) you will practice how to turn the more challenging frustrations you have with your partner into specific requests for growth and healing.<br><br>And Remember:<br><br>Ninety percent of our frustrations with our partner come from experiences from our past.<br><br>That means only 10 percent of the frustrations you currently have are about each other.<br>TRUTH #2<br><br>Incompatibility Is Grounds for Marriage<br><br>Harville<br><br>Why will the work on your marriage be challenging? Not only is the person you&#x2019;re married to like your parents, but the two of you are also incompatible. It&#x2019;s as if there is a universal design and, mysteriously, our incompatibility seems to be a key piece of this plan. As you&#x2019;ll see, incompatibility plays a crucial role in preparing you and your partner to meet each other&#x2019;s needs.<br><br>This is why we say that incompatibility is grounds for marriage.<br><br>And, honestly, compatibility is grounds for boredom.<br><br>We&#x2019;ve seen it time and again. People want to believe they&#x2019;ve fallen in love with someone who is a lot like them. But the fact is we&#x2019;re drawn to people who are, in certain ways, our polar opposite. This is why Romantic Love needs to be such a powerful force. Without it, we&#x2019;d see the truth of our incompatibility right away--and run screaming in the other direction!<br><br>Helen and I were really incompatible. I grew up on a sharecropper&#x2019;s farm in rural Georgia. She grew up in a mansion overlooking a lake in Dallas. I was dirt poor. She was Texas-oil rich. My father died just after I was born, leaving my mother alone with nine children on a mortgaged one-hundred-acre farm. Mom died when I was six years old. One of the few things Helen and I had in common was this: I grew up an orphan in the care of my older sisters; she grew up &#x201c;orphaned&#x201d; in a house with busy household staff and even busier parents.<br><br>Helen is a nester. I am a wanderer. She is internal, and I&#x2019;m oriented to the outer world. On a car trip, I&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t this scenery great?&#x201d; Only then would she look up from her needlepoint. Helen has a minimal relationship to time, and I am obsessively punctual. If she knocks and a door doesn&#x2019;t open, she keeps knocking. I go to another door. She likes her vegetables soft. I like mine barely cooked or raw.<br><br>Helen is intuitive and understands complexity immediately. I&#x2019;m logical. By the time I get to the solution, she&#x2019;s at the finish line waiting for me to arrive. Helen is a great multi-tasker. That used to drive me nuts! I&#x2019;m still better when I focus on one thing at a time.<br><br>There&#x2019;s an old song from the movie My Fair Lady, &#x201c;Why Can&#x2019;t a Woman Be More Like a Man?&#x201d; I can&#x2019;t tell you how many times I&#x2019;ve lamented, &#x201c;Why Can&#x2019;t Helen Be More Like Me?&#x201d; Unfortunately, this kind of lament can only lead to one thing. . . .<br>ENTER THE POWER STRUGGLE<br><br>&#x201c;You never . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You ALWAYS . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re such a . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Welcome to the dark valley of the Power Struggle. Each of you is deeply entrenched in believing you&#x2019;re right. If only your partner would see how truly wonderful you are. Oh, and also agree to do everything you&#x2019;ve asked for (or hinted at, or privately wished for but haven&#x2019;t said), exactly the way you want them to do it. Then everything would be FINE. The Power Struggle is absolutely miserable. But, guess what? Yes, you&#x2019;re catching on. . . .</p><h2>My Ideal Jesus: Son Of Mary</h2><p>A famous little book based on the teaching of Fr.

He later served as rector of the Marianist seminary of Fribourg, Switzerland, a position he held for twenty-seven years. For Father Neubert, devotion to the Blessed Mother meant winning souls for Christ, and winning souls meant promoting devotion to her. He was a witty man with a fine sense of humor, and unwavering in his strong devotion to Mary.

As in some of her previous books, she creates words to express various sounds throughout the text. Whether it's the t-lopping of a wave, the che, che, che of laughter or a crab making a guga, guga, guga sound as it skitters along, young and old alike will enjoy vocalizing the interpretations of these unique words. A little girl, Bimwili, is captured by an ugly troll-like character known as a Zimwi. The Zimwi forces the child to stay inside his drum and sing for the inhabitants of various villages. Bimwili is saved when she sings in her own village and her mother recognizes her voice. Meddaugh combines watercolors and colored pencils to create vivid, softly textured illustrations. Her characterization of the Zimwi is particularly interesting in that he looks both foreboding and vulnerable at the same time. Coming from a culture so steeped in oral tradition, it is no surprise that this tale makes for lively fun whether read independently or aloud. Tom S.

Now twenty-four, Phoenix is launching a career as an R &amp; B singer. She's living out her dreams and seems destined for fame and fortune. But a chance visit to a historical site in St. Louis ignites a series of bizarre, erotic encounters with a spirit who may be the King of Ragtime, Scott Joplin. <br> <br> The sound of Scott Joplin is strange enough to the ears of the hip-hop generation. But the idea that these antique sounds are being channeled through Phoenix? Her life is suddenly hanging in the balance. How will she find her true voice and calling? Can the power of her own inner song give Phoenix the strength to fight to live out her own future? Or will she be forever trapped in Scott Joplin's doomed, tragic past? Stunningly original, <i>Joplin's Ghost</i> is a novel filled with art and intrigue -- and is sure to bring music to readers' ears.</p><p><b>Tananarive Due </b>is an American Book Award-winning, <i>Essence</i> bestselling author of <i>Blood Colony, The Living Blood, The Good House, </i>and<i> Joplin&#x2019;s Ghost. </i>She lives in Atlanta, Georgia. Visit her blog at TananariveDue.blogspot.com.<p> <b>Prelude: A Piano</b> </p><p> <b>I.</b> </p><p> 1917 </p><p> The new arrival wheeled himself through the day room of Manhattan State Hospital on Ward's Island, whispering to his dead wife, who always walked beside him. The man had outlived one wife and his baby girl -- <i>pure bad luck</i>, his first wife had called him. His second wife, Freddie, was the only one of the dead who still enjoyed his company. </p><p> He was talking to her, as he often did, about the stage set he was going to build as soon as he was able: murals of cloud banks, majestic live oaks and a sea of ripening cornstalks. Talking to Freddie was like walking onto the stage itself, standing in the stare of a footlight. The light filled him with wonder, and wonder was hard to come by these days. </p><p> But Freddie's voice interrupted him so loudly that he wondered why the droop-jawed attendant in the doorway didn't call for them to hush that racket near so many insane and dying. </p><p> <i>There it is</i>, Scott, Freddie said, quivering his ear. <i>There -- do you see?</i> </p><p> Scott Joplin gazed around the room, where the streaked windows invited in an awful dead winter sun that stole more than it gave. Institutional wooden chairs circled a scuffed old table that offered two checkerboards but no checkers, beside a Graphophone with a working motor but no needle to play the cylinders. A sobbing younger man sat cross-legged on the floor, his nest of privates in plain view from a hollow in his thin, urine-stained gown. Why would Freddie wrest him away from his beautiful setting to bring him back to this lunatic's meeting hall? </p><p> Do you see it? Freddie, as always, was persistent. </p><p> Then, he did see it: An upright piano stood against the far wall. Scott's eyes had missed it before because it was in a shadowed corner, nearly invisible in the room's bland light. It was his rosewood Rosenkranz, the piano he had found in the alleyway when he could still stand and walk. The piano he had played for Freddie during her dying days. Scott blinked, sure it was a trick of his imagination. One always must be on guard against one's imagination, he remembered."Did you do this somehow, Freddie?" Scott said. At Bellevue, his last home, he'd been forced to live without a piano within reach for the first time in memory. But here he was in a new place -- a worse place, one step closer to oblivion -- and his own piano was waiting for him. </p><p> Another hallucination, then. It wasn't the first, and wouldn't be his last, or so his doctors said. Every day held another bizarre surprise. But this hallucination was more stubborn than most. Scott flopped his arms against the wheels of his wheelchair, making slow progress across the room, and the piano remained in place. Closer, now. And closer again. </p><p> "I'll be damned," he said, panting from his effort. </p><p> Scott reached out his trembling hand. Although his wrist dangled as if it were broken, he was able to press a single key. High G. No hallucination could sound so sweet. </p><p> The single, delicate note awoke the memory of being at Lessie Mae's on Main Street in Sedalia, waiting quietly in the wings while Happy Eddie or Mo the Show clowned on the piano with acrobatic fervor for the hooting crowd. Those boys played like carnival performers, drawing men's purposeful eyes away from bold cleavage and half-empty glasses of whiskey. When it was Scott's turn to play, Lessie Mae always waved at him with her damp pink handkerchief from behind the cash register, her mark of approval. <i>Go on, Scotty -- TEACH 'em, professor!</i> </p><p> When he played, the carnival ended. A concert began. </p><p> "Music's swell. You play?" the sanitarium attendant said to Scott. </p><p> Scott nodded slowly. He did everything slowly now. "Used to," he said. His voice was a sick old man's, and he wasn't yet forty-nine. He couldn't always remember his age, but the sight of the burnished piano had brightened his mind. Brightened every part of him. </p><p> "Go on ahead and take five minutes, then. They say a lady donated it to the hospital in a patient's name. Mind you don't break it." </p><p> Break it! That was a stupid thing to say. <i>The woman who sent it was my wife, you fool. Don't you know who I am?</i> Scott thought. But that was the point, wasn't it? He was the only one who knew, and the occasional ability to forget was the only part of his illness he enjoyed. Lottie <i>had</i> said she'd have a surprise for him when she came to see him this Friday, but she'd never said she was sending the piano after him. God bless Lottie again. </p><p> <i>But this piano would have followed you whether Lottie sent it or not</i>, Scott thought, and such thoughts didn't disturb him the way they used to. Accepting the state of things had made his days easier. The Rosenkranz would follow him anywhere he went. He had found the Rosenkranz in the alley and wiped it clean with his own hands, and the Rosenkranz wouldn't forget. </p><p> "I think I will play," Scott said. His tongue was no longer useful, and his words had sounded like <i>ayethinnniwillplayyyy</i>, a mouthful of oatmeal. </p><p> He hadn't let anybody except Lottie hear him play a piano in two years, since that show in D.C. where they had practically pushed him on the stage. What could he have done? <i>Sounded like a little child</i>. That's what he heard Eubie Blake said. </p><p> "Yeah -- I'll p-play." He was excited now. </p><p> Scott's wheelchair was too low for him to reach the keyboard comfortably, so he hoisted himself into the mismatched chair at the piano's knees, another labor that took his breath. The attendant steadied him, but Scott had moved out of his chair by himself, so he <i>wasn't</i> helpless. For a moment, Scott felt bewildered as he stared at his hands, shivering claws against the keys. His skin didn't smell right either -- urine and talcum and something else buried beneath it all, something sickly that could only be Death. That smell was everywhere here. </p><p> "Do you know 'I'm in Love with the Mother of My Best Girl'?" the attendant said. "I love that one. It's a hoot." </p><p> Scott nodded, but only to silence him. Anything he played was sure to be unrecognizable. The Rosenkranz was not a forgiving piano; he'd learned that the first night they were reunited. But he would play, if only because Lottie wanted him to. Small solace was better than none at all. </p><p> Habit took Scott's hands to a natural pose, and his fingers plunged, striking the opening notes. The music plodded like old honey hugging the bottom of the jar, but he was shocked his fingers remembered how to move at his bidding at all. <i>Maybe I CAN play a tune or two -- </i> </p><p> Scott's middle finger slipped, curdling the melody with a B-natural in the second measure. He cringed, playing on, but his piano didn't offer him any music -- only awful, mind-rending noise. </p><p> <i>You coldhearted trickster</i>, Scott thought, remembering the old conjurer from the train who had celebrated the chance to curse him with his fate all those years ago. <i>Are you and your master happy with what you've reduced me to?</i> </p><p> Scott let out a soundless moan, suddenly striking his hand against the keys so hard that the ragged edge of a keytop snagged his pinky, biting into his tender flesh. Droplets of Scott's warm, runny blood marked the piano keys with red fingerprints. Scott was so consumed in pain -- most of it in places people couldn't see -- that he had no senses left to notice something so trifling as torn skin. <i>But you don't mind, do you? You know the taste of blood already, don't you, my old friend?</i> The Rosenkranz had been soiled with blood the day he found it in the alley. If only he had recognized a bad omen when he saw one, he thought. He had been cursed all along! </p><p> Scott's lips parted to release a moan. His head drooped, suddenly too heavy to carry, and tears splashed from the tip of his nose to the piano keys, seeping between them, turning his blood pink and dampening his useless fingers. If he could choose his time and place to die, he had found it. <i>Take me, whatever your price, and let my soul rest here</i>. He prayed to anyone who would hear him. </p><p> Something made Scott look up, interrupting his tears. His tall, lovely girl-bride stood beside him, half-shrouded in misty light. Freddie had not shown herself to him since his confinement to this wretched place. My God! Could she be an emissary from the Hereafter? Was his prayer answered so quickly? </p><p> "Freddie?" he said, peering more closely at his beloved. Freddie's face was always dreamlike to him, in the way his dreams were often spare of details. Scott felt her spirit near him, yet he could not quite see the woman he remembered hidden in the light. </p><p> "I'm here, Scott." Her voice was not in his ear, this time, but from her lips. </p><p> "T-Take me with you." He couldn't even climb to his feet to go to her. She would have to carry him wherever he was going next. </p><p> "I'm sorry, Scott. I can't," she said. After all these years, now it was Freddie who sounded reasonable, and he had become rash. Freddie glided closer, until she stood directly over him. His nostrils longed for her scent, and he thought he smelled chrysanthemums. He tried to reach for her, but his arms failed to move, useless. </p><p> "Who're you talkin' to, Uncle?" the attendant called from across the room, where he was pushing a mop in halfhearted circles.

What if our brain has limits that prevent it from solving such complex problems? If ancient civilisations collapsed because they, too, hit a cognitive limitation, are we headed for a similar collapse, and if so, can it be prevented? Using historical and modern-day examples, &#34;The Watchman&#39;s Rattle&#34; describes the cognitive gridlock that sets in when complexity races ahead of the brain&#39;s ability to manage it. Beginning with the Mayans, Khmer and Roman Empires, Costa shows how the tendency to find a quick fix to problems by focusing on symptoms instead of searching for permanent solutions, leads to frightening long-term consequences: Society&#39;s ability to solve its most challenging, intractable problems becomes gridlocked, progress slows and collapse ensues. But, as Costa reveals, there is a growing body of scientific evidence that the human brain can be retrained to comprehend, analyse and resolve massively complex problems. A process of intuitive thinking, which Neuroscientists refer to as &#39;insight&#39;.

Weather inside: cozy and warm.</b></p><p><b>Enjoying life for once, or would be if Darcy hadn&#x2019;t gone off somewhere secret again&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</b></p><p><b>Why must he be so annoying!</b></p><p>By London standards, it was a dark and stormy night. Nothing like the wild gales that battered our castle in the Scottish Highlands, of course, but violent enough to make me glad I was safely indoors. Rain peppered the windows and drummed on the slates on the roof while a wild wind howled down the chimney. If I&#x2019;d been at Castle Rannoch, where I grew up, the wind would also have sent icy drafts rushing down the corridors, making tapestries flap and billow out so that it was almost as unpleasant indoors as it was out. But on this particular night I lay listening to the storm feeling snug, warm, comfortable and very thankful that I wasn&#x2019;t at Castle Rannoch. I was instead in my friend Belinda&#x2019;s mews cottage in Knightsbridge and enjoying every moment of it.</p><p>When I returned from America at the end of August&#x2014;having been dragged there by my mother who was seeking a quickie divorce from one of her husbands&#x2014;Mummy had immediately flitted away with the very briefest of good-byes as usual. She had abandoned her only child with monotonous regularity and barely a backward glance since that first time she bolted when I was two. But on this occasion she had actually demonstrated a spark of maternal feeling I hadn&#x2019;t known she possessed. As she left Brown&#x2019;s hotel she handed me a generous check. &#x201c;Georgie, darling, I want you to know that I think you behaved splendidly in Hollywood,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I simply couldn&#x2019;t have survived without you in that savage place.&#x201d;</p><p>I went pink and didn&#x2019;t quite know what to say as this was so out of character. &#x201c;Golly, thanks awfully,&#x201d; I managed to mumble.</p><p>&#x201c;I have to go back to Max in Germany, darling,&#x201d; she said, kissing me on the cheek, &#x201c;but I don&#x2019;t want you to think I&#x2019;m running out on you. You do know you are very welcome to come and stay whenever you want to.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, but I don&#x2019;t think Berlin would be to my liking,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Not since that horrible little Hitler chappie came into power. Too much shouting and strutting.&#x201d;</p><p>She gave that tinkling laugh that had delighted audiences across the world. &#x201c;Oh, darling. Nobody takes him seriously. I mean, who could with a mustache like that. He once kissed my hand and it was like an encounter with a hedgehog. Max says he&#x2019;s good for German morale at the moment but he can&#x2019;t last.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All the same, I&#x2019;d rather stay in good old England for a while,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That time in America was quite enough excitement for me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t mean to go home to Scotland?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Actually no,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not exactly welcome at Castle Rannoch these days, and Belinda told me I could use her London house while she stays on in Hollywood.&#x201d; I added, &#x201c;And now you&#x2019;ve given me this check, I can actually afford to eat for a while.&#x201d;</p><p>A frown crossed that lovely face. &#x201c;Darling, have there been times when you couldn&#x2019;t afford to eat?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oodles of them. I once survived for a month on tea and baked beans.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How disgusting. Really, Georgie, if you need something just ask. Max is revoltingly rich, you know. I could get him to make you an allowance, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t live off Max&#x2019;s money, Mummy. Granddad wouldn&#x2019;t approve, for one thing. Not German money. You know how Granddad would hate that after your brother was killed in the war.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One must learn to forgive and forget, as I keep telling your grandfather. And once we&#x2019;re married&#x2014;well, it will be my money too, won&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; She raised her hands excitedly. &#x201c;You must come over for the wedding! You can be my maid of honor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you really intend to marry him?&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to look at her.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s what he wants, so I suppose the answer is yes. We&#x2019;ll just have to see, won&#x2019;t we? Well, I must be toddling off, darling, if I&#x2019;m to catch the boat train. Take care of yourself and for God&#x2019;s sake let that gorgeous Darcy take you to bed as soon as possible. Virginity simply isn&#x2019;t fashionable or even acceptable after twenty.&#x201d;</p><p>And with that she was gone. I had moved into Belinda&#x2019;s lovely little London mews home and had enjoyed playing a lady of leisure for a while. The one aspect of my happiness that was lacking was that Darcy was off on another secret assignment and I had no idea when he&#x2019;d return to London or how I could contact him. Really, he was the most infuriating man. I knew he did things that were often hush-hush (I suspected he might even occasionally work undercover for MI5) but an occasional postcard from Buenos Aires or Calcutta would have been nice.</p><p>A particularly violent gust of wind made the window frame rattle. I pulled the blankets up and curled into a little ball, enjoying the knowledge that I was safe and warm. The money that Mummy had given me wouldn&#x2019;t last forever, but I hoped at least I could stretch it out until after Christmas. If only I could find some kind of job, I could go on living here until Belinda came home&#x2014;and who knew when that would be if she became a successful costume designer in Hollywood. But jobs didn&#x2019;t seem to exist for young women like me, trained only to snare a husband. I was even toying with the idea of applying for a temporary Christmas job at one of the department stores, if I didn&#x2019;t think that the news might leak back to my relatives and cause a stink.</p><p>And in case you&#x2019;re wondering why my relatives should care if I worked behind the counter in Selfridges or Gamages I should point out that they were not exactly your run-of-the-mill, ordinary people&#x2014;they were the king and queen. My great-grandmother was Queen Victoria so I was half royal, expected to behave in a way that befitted my station without being given the means to do so. Jolly unfair, actually.</p><p>I pushed worrying thoughts aside. For the moment all was well. It had been remarkably peaceful, since my maid, Queenie, had been absent for the last few weeks. She had gone home to look after her mother, who had been hit by a tram while crossing Walthamtow High Street and broken her leg. But the leg had healed and Queenie was due to return to me any day now. I was anticipating it with mixed emotions since Queenie was the most utterly hopeless maid in the history of the universe. In fact I rather suspected that her family was urging her to hurry back to me, not because of any sense of duty but because they couldn&#x2019;t wait to get rid of her. I sighed, settled down and let my mind drift to more pleasant subjects. I was half asleep when I heard a noise that jerked me instantly awake again.</p><p>Over the noise of the wind and rain I had heard the distinct metallic click of a latch, followed by the sound of a door being opened. Somebody was coming into the house. I wondered if I had forgotten to lock the door before I went to bed, but I definitely remembered doing so. I was out of bed in a flash. Belinda&#x2019;s cottage was really tiny, with a flight of stairs leading up to the bedroom I was occupying, a bathroom and a minute maid&#x2019;s room. I looked around desperately. There was nowhere to hide if burglars had broken in. I examined the bed, but Belinda had piled boxes and trunks under it. The wardrobe was still full of her clothes. I wondered if perhaps I could tiptoe across the hall to the box room, or better yet the bathroom. Surely no burglar would think of looking in the bath?</p><p>I opened the door cautiously and was about to peer around it when I heard the sound of low voices in the hallway down below. Golly. More than one of them. I glanced back into the room to see if there was anything I might use as a weapon&#x2014;but I didn&#x2019;t think the frail china table lamp would be much good, even if I could unplug it in time. Then I heard a laugh that I recognized. Belinda&#x2019;s laugh. She had come home unexpectedly and she was probably talking to the taxi driver who was carrying in her luggage. I was about to step out to greet her when I heard her say, &#x201c;Toby, you are so naughty. Now stop that, at least until I have my gloves off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t wait, you delectable creature,&#x201d; said a deep man&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to rip off all your clothes, throw you down on that bed and give you one hell of a good ravishing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are certainly not going to rip anything,&#x201d; Belinda said, laughing again. &#x201c;I happen to like my clothes. But you may undress me as quickly as you like.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good show,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been dying to bed you since we first danced together on the ship. But too many watchful eyes. It was dashed clever of you to suggest coming back here rather than a hotel. A man in my position can&#x2019;t be too careful, don&#x2019;t you know.&#x201d;</p><p>Toby? I thought. Sir Toby Blenchley, cabinet minister? I had no time to consider this as they were now heading for the stairs. I stood behind that door in an agony of embarrassment and indecision. Surely she couldn&#x2019;t have forgotten that I was occupying her house, and thus her bedroom, could she? Did she really think it would be acceptable to roll in the hay with a cabinet minister while I was there? Where did she expect me to go while they were thus engaged? I sighed in exasperation. How typically Belinda.</p><p>I heard her giggle and say, &#x201c;My, but you are impatient, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; as they came up the stairs. What on earth was I to do? Leap out on them and say, &#x201c;Welcome home, Belinda, darling. Perhaps you had forgotten that you&#x2019;d lent your house to your best friend?&#x201d; Sir Toby wasn&#x2019;t in the first flush of youth. What if the surprise brought on a heart attack? On the other hand, there was now no way I could cross the upstairs landing to the maid&#x2019;s room, and I certainly didn&#x2019;t want to be trapped in there listening to their hijinks.</p><p>Then it was decided for me. Belinda ran up the rest of the stairs calling, &#x201c;Come on then, last one into bed is a sissy!&#x201d; She pushed open the bedroom door with full force, trapping me behind it. She had several robes hanging from the back of that door and these were now in my face. I heard the sounds of two people undressing hurriedly. Maybe if I kept quiet and didn&#x2019;t move he&#x2019;d have his way with her and then go, I decided. Better still, maybe they&#x2019;d both fall asleep and I could creep out and take refuge in the box room.</p><p>&#x201c;God, you really are delectable,&#x201d; I heard him say. &#x201c;Those neat little breasts. Enough to drive a man wild. Come here.&#x201d;</p><p>I heard bedsprings creak, a grunt, a sigh. Then something terrible happened. One of Belinda&#x2019;s robes was trimmed with feathers. And one of these feathers was now tickling my nose. To my horror I realized I was going to sneeze. I was pinned so tightly behind the door that it was hard for me to get my hand up to my nose. I managed it just in time and clamped my fingers over my nose and mouth. The noises on the bed were getting more violent and urgent. The sneeze was still lingering, waiting to come out the moment I let go. I willed it to go away but I had to breathe. And then, in spite of everything, it came out, a great big &#x201c;A&#x2014;choo,&#x201d; just at the moment when Belinda was moaning &#x201c;Oh yes, oh yes.&#x201d;</p><p>It was amazing how quickly the room fell silent.</p><p>&#x201c;What the devil was that?&#x201d; Sir Toby asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s in the house.&#x201d; I heard the bed creak as Belinda got up.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought you said there&#x2019;d be nobody here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It must be my maid, although I didn&#x2019;t tell her I was coming home,&#x201d; Belinda said. &#x201c;How could she have known? I&#x2019;ll go and see if she&#x2019;s sleeping in her room.&#x201d; Then she lowered her voice. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go away, you big brute. I&#x2019;ll be back and we can continue from where we left off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about that,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not if your maid&#x2019;s in the house. Is she likely to gossip?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My maid is paid very well to close her eyes to anything that goes on in my bedroom,&#x201d; Belinda said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to worry, Toby, I promise you. I&#x2019;ll just get my robe.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>And she swung the door open.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Chapter 2</i></p><p>It was fortunate that the storm outside was making such a racket or her scream would have been heard all the way to Victoria Station and maybe even across the Thames.</p><p>&#x201c;Belinda, it&#x2019;s all right,&#x201d; I said, reaching out to touch her. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me. Georgie.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh God.&#x201d; She was gasping now, her hand over her naked heart. &#x201c;Georgie. Have you gone mad? What on earth are you doing hiding in my bedroom?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry if I scared you, Belinda,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t intend to hide, but by the time I&#x2019;d woken up and heard you coming up the stairs it was too late to do anything sensible. And you were the one who pushed the door open so hard, trapping me behind it.&#x201d;</p><p>Sir Toby was standing up beside the bed and had obviously just realized he was naked in the presence of a strange female. He grabbed a lace-trimmed, heart-shaped pillow and attempted to hold it over the important parts. He looked old and ridiculous and quite unlike the masterful, dapper man whose picture I had seen on newsreels and in magazines. &#x201c;You know this person, Belinda?&#x201d; he demanded. &#x201c;Should we call the police?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh no, of course not,&#x201d; Belinda said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s my best friend&#x2014;Georgiana Rannoch.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lady Georgiana, sister of the Duke of Rannoch?&#x201d; Sir Toby said. &#x201c;Good God. But what&#x2019;s she doing in your house? In your bedroom, for God&#x2019;s sake?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve no idea, Toby.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;d had enough. They were both looking at me with horror and suspicion as if I were a dangerous cornered animal. &#x201c;Perhaps in the heat of passion you forgot that you invited me to stay in your house while you were away, Belinda,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And you might have given me advance warning that you were coming back.&#x201d;</p><p>Belinda had taken down one of the robes and was in the process of trying to put it on. I noticed that her body was curvier than when we had shared a room as teenagers at a finishing school in Switzerland. No wonder men were so attracted to her.</p><p>&#x201c;I remember mentioning that you could use my house,&#x201d; Belinda said as she successfully pulled on the robe and tied it at her waist, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;d no idea that you&#x2019;d taken me up on it. You might have dropped me a note to tell me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dropped you a note?&#x201d; I was fully indignant now. &#x201c;Belinda, I wrote you two letters. And since I didn&#x2019;t know where you&#x2019;d be staying, I addressed one to you, care of Golden Pictures, and one, care of the Beverly Hills Hotel. Do you mean to tell me you didn&#x2019;t receive either of them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I didn&#x2019;t receive them. I never went back to Golden Pictures. It&#x2019;s been virtually shut down by Mr. Goldman&#x2019;s widow; at least all work is halted for now. And my budget certainly didn&#x2019;t run to the Beverly Hills Hotel.&#x201d;</p><p>Sir Toby cleared his throat. &#x201c;Given the circumstances, Belinda, I think I should depart as rapidly as possible. So if you young ladies don&#x2019;t mind stepping outside while I get dressed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Belinda followed me out onto the landing. &#x201c;Honestly, Georgie. You&#x2019;ve spoiled everything.&#x201d;</p><p>She stood there, glaring at me while I squirmed in embarrassment.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, but you did offer and I did write to tell you. And I&#x2019;m not about to walk out into the storm at this hour so that you can finish your little tryst with a cabinet minister.&#x201d;</p><p>Sir Toby emerged, now looking more like himself i...</p></p><h2>Bernie Whitebear: An Urban Indian&#39;s Quest for Justice</h2><p><b>When American Indians left reservations in the 1950s,</b> enticed by the federal government&#x2019;s relocation program, many were drawn to cities like Tacoma and Seattle. But in these new homes they found unemployment and discrimination, and they were no better off. Sin Aikst Indian Bernie Whitebear was an urban activist in the Pacific Northwest during the last decades of the twentieth century, a man dedicated to improving the lives of Indians and other ethnic groups by working for change and justice. He unified Northwest tribes to fight for the return of their land and was the first to accomplish this in the United States. But far from a fearsome agitator, Bernie was a persuasive figure who won the praise and admiration of an entire community. Bernie began organizing powwows in the 1960s with an eye toward greater authenticity; and by making a name in the Seattle area as an entertainment promoter, he soon became a successful networker and master of diplomacy, enabling him to win over those who had long ignored the problems of urban Indians. Soft-spoken but outspoken, Bernie successfully negotiated with officials at all levels of government on behalf of Indians and other minorities, crossing into political territory normally off-limits to his people.<br><br> Bernie Whitebear&#x2019;s story takes readers from an impoverished youth&#x2014;including a rare account of life on the Colville Reservation during the 1930s&#x2014;to the &#x201c;Red Power&#x201d; movement as it traces Bernie&#x2019;s emergence as an activist influenced by contemporaries such as Bob Satiacum, Vine DeLoria, and Joe Delacruz. By choosing this course, Bernie was clearly making a break with his past, but with an eye toward a better future, whether staging the successful protest at Fort Lawton or acting on behalf of Native fishing rights in Puget Sound. When he died in July 2000, Bernie Whitebear had left an inestimable legacy, accomplishing things that no other Indian seemed able to do. His biography is an inspiring story for readers at many levels, an account of how one American Indian overcame hardships and obstacles to make a difference in the lives of his people&#x2014;and an entire community.</p><p>Lawney L. Reyes, brother of Bernie Whitebear, is an award-winning artist and the author of <i>White Grizzly Bear&#x2019;s Legacy</i>. He lives in Seattle.Whitebear was born to a Native American mother and Filipino father in 1937 and emerged from an impoverished childhood to become an influential Indian-rights activist who earned the respect of senators and governors and served on the board of the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian until his death in 2000. His older brother now tells Whitebear's remarkable story. His first cause was Indian salmon-fishing rights on the Columbia River; later Whitebear worked with Seattle's "urban Indians," teaching them how to straddle cultures and not abandon their traditions. He organized powwows that led to the formation of the United Indians of All Tribes and to the completion of their spectacular cultural center outside Seattle. He networked with other minorities to raise money for educational and employment services, Head Start and GED programs, and multicultural art centers. Reyes' tribute to his brother is uplifting and informative, offering a firsthand view of the progress of Indian rights during the last half of the twentieth century. <i>Deborah Donovan</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

The Girl even told her she would, because she and StingRay sleep together, every single night, on the high bed with the fluffy pillows. But in the end, when the suitcases were packed and the car loaded,the Girl and her parents drove away--and StingRay was left behind. &nbsp; Plastic, being only a ball, had not expected to go on the trip. No one plays with balls in snowy weather. She is here with StingRay and Lumphy in the empty house, finding it strange to have days go by without the good-natured ruckus of the people who livethere. No alarm clocks, no morning bustle, no baths, no cooking smells. No laughter, no arguments, no stories read aloud. &nbsp; The house is cold. &nbsp; For several days--they are not sure how many--Lumphy, StingRay, and Plastic play checkers and Hungry Hungry Hippos with the toy mice and the one-eared sheep. They chat with the rocking horse in the corner and with TukTuk, the old yellow towel in the hallwaybathroom. They watch television. But the hours go by much more slowly than usual. There is always the feeling of someone missing. The Girl they love. &nbsp; "When is she coming back, again?" Plastic wonders one afternoon. She and Lumphy are on the windowsill, downstairs in the living room. Lumphy is watching the snow falling outside, and Plastic has been reading a book about cheese--kinds of cheese, whereit comes from, and how it's made. She is flipping the pages herself with a rolling technique she's invented. &nbsp; "The Saturday before school starts again, is what they said," Lumphy answers. He feels sick to his stomach when he thinks about how the Girl isn't here. &nbsp; "What Saturday is that?" Plastic asks. &nbsp; "I don't know. A week is how long they'll be gone." &nbsp; "But how long is a week?" Plastic persists. &nbsp; "StingRay says five days." &nbsp; "What day is it now?" wonders Plastic. "Is it Tuesday? I think it's maybe Tuesday." She rocks anxiously from side to side. &nbsp; "Urmph," mumbles Lumphy. He is counting in his head. &nbsp; "What are the days besides Tuesday, anyhow?" continues Plastic. "Does it go Onesday, Tuesday, Threesday, Foursday?" &nbsp; "I think they have already been gone more than five days," announces Lumphy. &nbsp; "You mean we already had Tuesday?" &nbsp; "I mean we already had Saturday," says Lumphy. "I mean, the week is up." &nbsp; Fwap! Gobble-a gobble-a. &nbsp; Fwap! Gobble-a gobble-a. &nbsp; They are interrupted. &nbsp; Fwap! Gobble-a gobble-a. &nbsp; StingRay is falling down the stairs. Flipper over plush flipper, bouncing first off the wall, then off the posts beneath the banister. &nbsp; Fwap! Gobble-a gobble-a. &nbsp; Fwap! Gobble-a gobble-a. And then eventually: Bonk! &nbsp; She lands at the bottom. &nbsp; Lumphy climbs gingerly off the windowsill while Plastic bounces over to StingRay. "Are you okay?" &nbsp; StingRay is lying on her back, and her head hurts where she banged it on a post, but she quickly turns over on her tummy and brushes her eye with her left flipper. "What do you mean?" &nbsp; "You fell down the stairs." &nbsp; "I don't know what you're talking about. I come down that way all the time on purpose." StingRay changes the subject. "What have you been doing?" &nbsp; "I was reading!" Plastic tells her. "Did you know cheese is made in caves? Because it is! You put milk in a cave and out comes cheese!" &nbsp; "Of course I knew that," says StingRay, although she didn't. "Listen. Do you know where the playing cards are? I can't find them anywhere and I want to play Fish." &nbsp; Plastic and Lumphy agree to help look for the cards. They search the downstairs, checking bookshelves and the drawers of the coffee table--but the cards are not there. They go upstairs: Lumphy climbing, StingRay lurching up each step with a strong pushof her tail, and Plastic bouncing easily, five stairs at a time. &nbsp; They look through the Girl's bedroom again. Search under the high bed. Look behind the box that holds the board games. &nbsp; Then they realize: the Girl has packed the cards. She has taken them with her on vacation, where she has not taken Lumphy, or Plastic, or StingRay. &nbsp; "What else has she packed?" cries StingRay, frantic. She flops herself across the bedroom carpet. "Did she pack that book about the mouse in the dungeon?" &nbsp; Plastic takes a high bounce to look on the bedside table. "It's not here." &nbsp; "Now we'll never find out what happens!" moans StingRay. "What else did she pack?" &nbsp; Their survey reveals that the Girl has packed not only the book about the mouse in the dungeon and the deck of cards but a box of dominoes, a carton of LEGOs, a paint box and a pad of art paper, a jigsaw puzzle of a triceratops, two Barbie dolls that don'ttalk and never have, and a vinyl box of Barbie outfits. &nbsp; "Oh no!" StingRay cries when Plastic and Lumphy present her with the total. "Why did she take all the second-rate toys and leave us?" &nbsp; "There, there," says Plastic. "She just . . ." &nbsp; "She just what? She just forgot us, that's what! Forgot us and took those Barbie dolls who don't even say anything at all!" &nbsp; "Maybe she went to a place that was good for Barbies," says Plastic. "Some kind of special Barbie place, where stingrays would get bored." &nbsp; "Oh yeah?" StingRay throws herself on the carpet in distress. "And she needs her paint box there? &nbsp; And her dominoes? &nbsp; She hardly even likes the dominoes. &nbsp; She never does puzzles! &nbsp; She doesn't love me! &nbsp; She's left me!" &nbsp; "She's coming back," says Plastic. "She's coming back on Saturday." She doesn't tell StingRay what Lumphy told her--that maybe Saturday is already over. &nbsp; "By Saturday she'll have forgotten all about us!" cries StingRay. Now she is twisting over and back on the carpet, gasping and sobbing. &nbsp; And sobbing some more. &nbsp; And even more sobbing. &nbsp; This can't go on, thinks Lumphy. He has to do something.</p><h2>Collaborative Action Research for Professional Learning Communities</h2><p>This book is designed to assist individual teachers, groups of teachers, and school leaders who work with professional learning community (PLC) teams to become disciplined and deliberative with data as they design and implement program improvements to enhance student learning. The evidence suggests that when constant, high-quality collaborative inquiry becomes the norm in a PLC, not only do students prosper but the school culture becomes enriched and teachers enjoy greater professional satisfaction. In dysfunctional organizations, norms and habits of behavior work counter to goals. In contrast, a PLC has a tight functional culture. Its members are bound by a commitment to shared norms, values, and behaviors. One nurtures a functional culture by reinforcing those habitual behaviors or norms. This book discusses five habits of inquiry that contribute to successful professional learning and provides detailed steps for developing each of them. Habit of Inquiry 1: Clarifying a Shared Vision for Success. The essence of this habit is regular discussion, both formally and informally, of valued outcomes. Habit of Inquiry 2: Articulating Theories of Action. Research needs to be guided by a framework or theory. This habit of inquiry shows how to use group action planning to develop theories of action that can be displayed visually, in the form of graphics. Habit of Inquiry 3: Acting Purposefully While Collecting Data. This habit of inquiry involves using specific strategies and tools when collecting data for research that will uncover the story embedded in the data. . Habit of Inquiry 4: Analyzing Data Collaboratively. This habit of inquiry provides processes for analyzing data collectively. Habit of Inquiry 5: Informed Team Action Planning. Based upon the thoughtful collaborative work of analyzing the data, learning communities revise the original theory of action and share the results with the community.</p><p>Richard Sagor is the founding director of the Institute for the Study of Inquiry in Education (ISIE), a consulting service dedicated to advancing the professional growth capacity of local school faculties. In the Spring of 2008, Dick retired from his position as director of the Educational Leadership Program at Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Oregon. Prior to Lewis &amp; Clark, he served as a professor of Educational Leadership at Washington State University and directed Project LEARN (the League of Educational Action Researchers in the Northwest). Before entering higher education Dick had fourteen years of public school administrative experience, including service as an assistant superintendent, high school principal, instruction vice principal, disciplinary vice-principal, and alternative school head teacher. He has taught a range of students, from the gifted to the learning disabled, in social studies, reading, and written composition. Educated in the public schools of New York, Dick received his B.A degree from New York University before moving to the Pacific Northwest, where he earned two M.A. Degrees and a Ph.D. in curriculum and instruction from the University of Oregon. Dick has done extensive consulting experience. He has worked as a site visitor for the United States Department of Education's Blue Ribbon School Program and has consulted with numerous state departments of education and hundreds of independent school districts across North America. He has also provided staff development workshops for international schools in Asia, South America, and Africa. His consulting is focused primarily on data and standard-based school improvement, professional learning communities, collaborative action research, teacher motivation, leadership development, and teaching at-risk youth. His articles on school reform and action research have received awards from the National Association of Secondary School Principals and the Educational Press Association of America. Dick has written nine books, including Guiding School Improvement with Action Research, The Action Research Guidebook: A 4-Stage Process for Educators and School Teams, Motivating Students and Teachers in an Era of Standards, At-Risk Students: Reaching and Teaching Them, and The TQE Principal: A Transformed Leader.Richard Sagor offers school leaders an instructional leadership tool powerful enough to help a principal enhance both teacher and student learning within the school context. It does this by creating a culture in which educators collaboratively and systematically address the dilemmas that teachers and students face each day. Collaborative Action Research sets the stage for schools to make change a part of the work they do each day. --Diane Yendol-Hoppey, professor and Benedum Collaborative Director, West Virginia University<br><br>Richard Sagor s writing is alive, and written from the perspective of someone who truly honors educators and learning. This book goes beyond how to use the five Habits of Inquiry to design and implement an education architecture that supports collaborative inquiry. It presents a viable process for universal student success. --Jan Morrison, Project Director, Washoe County School District, Reno, Nevada</p><h2>Techno-Fix: Why Technology Won&#39;t Save Us Or the Environment</h2><p><i>Techno-Fix</i> questions a primary paradigm of our age: that advanced technology will extricate us from an ever increasing load of social, environmental, and economic ills. <i>Techno-Fix </i>shows why negative unintended consequences of science and technology are inherently unavoidable and unpredictable, why counter-technologies, techno-fixes, and efficiency improvements do not offer lasting solutions, and why modern technology, in the presence of continued economic growth, does not promote sustainability but instead hastens collapse.<br><br>The authors explore the reasons for the uncritical acceptance of new technologies; show that technological optimism is based on ignorance and that increasing consumerism and materialism, which have been facilitated by science and technology, have failed to increase happiness. The common belief that technological change is inevitable is questioned, the myth of the value-neutrality of technology is exposed and the ethics of the technological imperative: "what can be done should be done" is challenged. <i>Techno-Fix</i> asserts that science and technology, as currently practiced, cannot solve the many serious problems we face and that a paradigm shift is needed to reorient science and technology in a more socially responsible and environmentally sustainable direction.<br><br>The authors of <i>Techno-Fix </i>are inside observers of the technological scene. &nbsp;Educated and experienced in science and engineering, the authors deliver a highly readable, insightful and powerful critique of modern technology.<br><br>The readers of <i>Techno-Fix</i> will learn a number of inconvenient truths about science and technology, topics that are rarely, if ever, covered in the media or discussed among professionals.

But they will also feel empowered and inspired by the fact that most problems confronting humanity have inherently simple, low-tech solutions.<b> </b><br><br>Who should read <i>Techno-Fix</i>?

There was something perhaps about the bar&#x2019;s large parasol umbrellas, lit starkly by the hanging naked bulbs. Or it could have been the figures flitting behind them, beyond my view.<br><br>I had sensed his presence, his curt movements. But they did not seem malicious. Then he lunged for my table, and I found myself running in the night. I ran with all my force. And I would have said I was faster than him. But I might have imagined my own speed from the people who passed me by like pages in a flip-book: mamas with bananas on their heads, vendors carting cages of birds and monkeys, the crocodile-leather pointy-shoed bureaucrats. They turned to stare at me, the whites of their eyes stabbing the darkness and piercing my face, my side, my back. Who are you looking at? He&#x2019;s the thief, stop him!<br><br>I squinted to keep sight. His form was like an illusion&#x2014;feet leaping off the earth, driving up plumes of dust. His hands pulled at his falling shorts; and when he looked back to see I was still running he screamed in surprise, showing dull teeth, and turned into a narrow passage.<br><br>We regressed from the city. The alleys amplified the darkness and my shallow breaths filled the spaces between the walls that rose on either side&#x2014;gray walls high and long between which I ran blindly, without thinking&#x2014;until we came to a field. And for a moment I lost sight of him.<br><br>I turned sharply, feeling a panic rise.<br><br>&#x201c;You!&#x201d; He appeared, empty-handed&#x2014;and jeering at me, almost as if he wanted to play. A sickly chicken of a boy, with limbs extending like antennae from his belly. &#x201c;You have my phone!&#x201d; I yelled. &#x201c;Tï¿½! I refuse!&#x201d; The ground was wet and yielding, covered in waste, cans, wrappers. The smell was rotten. It was like nothing I had known. A landfill in the middle of the city. Of what was I afraid?<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you money.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How much?&#x201d; He wiped his shoulder over his mouth; his face was covered in sweat.<br><br>A group of children skipped toward us. I reached into my pocket for my notebook and wallet. The boy turned, and I saw a wound on a hairless part of his scalp.<br><br>&#x201c;Keep the phone&#x201d;&#x2014;I pointed into my palm&#x2014;&#x201c;I only need the numbers inside.&#x201d; He smiled, as if smelling a trick. I felt frustrated at my carelessness. I didn&#x2019;t have money to hand out, and those numbers were precious. I was new in the country and had few friends. Most meetings had been gained by chance, in the street, at the odd conference, in a waiting room or at a bar; they had not been planned, necessary, or even particularly friendly. And yet they had taken on, in my mind, a great importance.<br><br>Kinshasa, when I first arrived, had felt giant, overwhelming. The scenes on the roads, the people moving from here to there, the languages, gestures, stares&#x2014;the smallest rituals had seemed imbued with meaning and purpose, and the city appeared as a collusion of secrets only the locals shared. But these strangers I had met&#x2014;journalists, businessmen, minor politicians&#x2014;had become bearings from which I navigated the confusion. With them I constructed a sense of place, and for moments felt part of the mystery. So the phone contained my personal map; and without it I felt lost, as though I had newly arrived for a second time and was again without connection. The bewilderment was now greater. And having exhausted the initial excitement of the new place, I now found the city distant, hostile.<br><br>My sigh came out heavy and sharp; it startled the boy. Already he was stepping away. I half tripped forward and yelled, &#x201c;How do I find you? What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Guy.&#x201d;<br><br>And, making a cackling noise, he ran behind a mound. I felt suddenly strained.<br><br>I could not tell the way by which I had come&#x2014;so I picked a nearby narrow street and followed it for a mile or two. The walk was not unpleasant. We were in the middle of a brief rainless period, in the summer; and there was a slight breeze. But even in this season the climate was humid and hot, and in such conditions everything grew quickly: the nails, the hair, the plants and insects. All attained giant or copious proportions. I stopped to inspect a falling banana tree. Its top was sappy, and crawling with red ants.<br><br>The city also grew daily. It was a center of migration for the region, like Sï¿½o Paulo or Calcutta, and already black Africa&#x2019;s largest capital&#x2014;a collapsed metropolis, unable to assure even the survival of its nine million people. But still the dispossessed came in floods from the villages.<br><br>I passed some women sitting on their porches, washing down their children from canisters of soapy brown water. They looked up. Bonjour, I said. Slowly they repeated the word, as though they had not expected it.<br><br>The main road was unlit and cars streamed past. People stood in packs, frantically waving their hands and rushing to each slowing taxi. I made a circle with my forefinger pointing at the ground and twenty minutes later found space in a minibus going north. My house was to the south, but it was the end of the working day and I was commuting like the masses. This was my way of finding a free seat.<br><br>I trembled incessantly&#x2014;as did the bus&#x2019;s plywood floor. The metal chassis around me was covered in the dents of countless collisions. The driver took us to the city&#x2019;s commercial area, cruising along the street edge and gathering passengers. A man hanging on the back of the bus constantly yelled our route. People swelled toward us like a sea. We sat in an old Volkswagen whose twelve cushioned seats had been pulled out and replaced with wooden benches; soon we were more than thirty inside, cramped side by side, hands between our knees. We squeezed more for the woman who brought in her drooling infant. The windows were sealed shut, so there was no breeze, and inside it was suffocating. The human smells engulfed us. But I looked through the glass and saw the movement; and this perception of the wind gave some false relief. We came to the harbor, with its broken heavy machinery. And the two- and three-story buildings stained with long black stripes: algae, rising from within the cement and blooming in the open. One imagined the decomposition that lived hidden within. The city seemed to be falling apart, building by building&#x2014;structures crumbled so slowly they seemed almost to melt. At a roundabout we circled a brick monument&#x2014;black, as though burned. The statue of the Belgian king had long been toppled, leaving two pillars framing an empty space. Lining the roads were heaps of garbage, glowing like embers and giving off black smoke.<br><br>The collapse, the crisis. It is how the world knows Congo. Death is as widespread in few places. Children born here have the bleakest futures. It is the most diseased, the most corrupt, and the least habitable&#x2014;the country heads nearly every conceivable blacklist. One survey has it that no nation has more citizens who want to leave.<br><br>And now we come to the mouth of the Boulevard, the city&#x2019;s artery. The bus, shivering, accelerates in the wide lanes. On both sides old trees with majestic green crowns and high-rises pass quickly. They still inspire awe. Not far away is the Congo River, opening into a pool and curling around us. One is reminded that this place, even in Europe, was once called the Beautiful, La Belle.<br><br>The Boulevard is soothing in a way&#x2014;this part of the city, one feels, has a certain vision, and was made with care. Buildings eighty and ninety years old are still intact, with porches and pillars and triangular eaves. Walls show traces of ocher. Old floors are of fine red and black oxide. The city is well planned, and traffic is congested only because wear has thinned the roads&#x2019; drivable widths and because of modern neighborhoods, haphazardly constructed. The boulevards are enormous, like in few African cities. The lampposts are tall, solid, evenly spaced. And the railway station has a monument in Latin, declaring the colonial project for which this city was made: &#x201c;Aperire Terram Gentibus&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;To Open the Land to the Nations.&#x201d;<br><br>Congo was then opened like a wound. And the world, continually seeking modernity, still consumes the country. A Belgian king committed genocide during the automobile revolution to pillage Congo for rubber&#x2014;the world needed tires then. Mid-century, the Belgian state initiated a war over Congo&#x2019;s copper, to wire the world for electricity. Congo&#x2019;s recent conflicts were heightened by the world&#x2019;s growing demand for tin, to make the conductors used in almost every electronic circuit. We currently live in what some say is the Fourth Great Pillage&#x2014;others call it the Fifth or Sixth. The world now needs cell phones, and Congo contains 60 percent of known reserves of an essential metal called tantalum. It is the curse: each progress in the world produces some new suffering. And a succession of Congolese leaders have tried, in their ways, to reclaim their land&#x2014;first Lumumba by expelling the white man and gaining independence from Belgium; then Mobutu by reviving the old Congolese idea of kingship; and finally the father Kabila, with his half-Marxist ideas of liberation. But even now the country gives the impression of being possessed by outside powers. Kabila&#x2019;s son, the president, seems himself overwhelmed. Much of the country is without government. The wealth has brought out the worst in man: greed, corruption, great violence.<br><br>These four men had defined Congo&#x2019;s history. Patrice Lumumba, the fiery politician who united the Congolese and remains the country&#x2019;s only true hero. Then Lumumba&#x2019;s onetime secretary, Joseph Mobutu, ruled as dictator for more than thirty years, with Western help, after having Lumumba assassinated in 1961, just six months after Congo&#x2019;s independence. The rebel Laurent Kabila&#x2014;the father Kabila&#x2014;in 1997 toppled the cancer-afflicted Mobutu. And when the father Kabila was himself assassinated four years later, it was his son, the relatively unknown Joseph Kabila, who was installed, and still presided over this naturally rich but ravaged country.<br><br>A Congolese legend has it that God, tired after creating the world, stopped at this part of the earth and dropped all his sacks of riches. Gold, diamonds, oil, silver, uranium, zinc, cobalt and tungsten. Such is the wealth&#x2014;they say you only have to dig and you are sure to find something, though you may not know its name. And it seems somehow significant that this wealth, which another culture might have interpreted as a divine reward, is described in Congolese legend as an accident. God only happened to be at this place.<br><br>The minibus turned in to the Avenue des Huileries, the Avenue of Oil Works&#x2014;we were now only a few miles from the journey&#x2019;s end&#x2014;where the bus had to share space with the pedestrians, and slow to their pace. As we shed the colonial structures, the past, buildings on the roads grew small and clustered, reflecting the country&#x2019;s anarchy. And against this backdrop the sluggish walkers appeared almost magical, like the survivors of a cataclysm. Men wore suits and fat-knotted ties, yellow and pink; women frilly fancy dresses. The shoes stepping in the mud were well polished, of fine leather. Rings of wetness showed under their arms on the satin. So laboriously beautiful&#x2014;the people had an air of character, defiance.<br><br>The north and the west of the city were affluent, particularly along the river. As the bus plunged inland, on every side opened up slum-like neighborhoods, vast, featureless, without light. We moved through one of these murky areas, and entered a busy market, with roaming figures. The sides of our bus began to be thumped. We were gently rocked. Suddenly our bus was mobbed. Children&#x2019;s wide-eyed faces pressed against my window. I drew away. &#x201c;Give me money,&#x201d; said the shapes of their lips, round as an O. &#x201c;Pesambongo.&#x201d; But it was useless&#x2014;our windows were fixed, and they could not even sell us their cool drinks, shoe shine or melting candy. Their desperate small hands stained the glass with wet palm prints. And they passed by like slow-motion pictures, glaring at us.<br><br>We at last arrived at the roar of Victoire, my neighborhood&#x2014;and one could feel the chaos become acute. It was a place of raw cement. Few buildings were even whitewashed. Occasionally a low wall would be made of brick, adding a touch of color. But Victoire was legendary in Africa&#x2014;revered, almost as a site of pilgrimage. Already, at this hour, from all parts of the city people would be coming; and beginning at 11:00 p.m., when Kinshasa&#x2019;s lights had mostly extinguished and the regular families had retired, here the vitality would resurge, creating an experience of almost pure pleasure and excitement. The music and meat grills would go all night. Saxophones would sound from terraces. Dancers would move like water: slow hips, tempting. The city would live a second life.<br><br>But now it seemed to oppress: the street of wooden stalls lit by kerosene lamps, where I alighted&#x2014;the stalls crooked, winged insects gathering around their glows, the earth pushing against their walls in chimneyed piles. The feeling, I knew, had something to do with the house, around the corner. I tried to delay getting back by running some errands.<br><br>The shop I made for was just down the road, but people and cars flowed incessantly: I was forced to move, and often against my intention. To be still anywhere was to be in the way.<br><br>And at the center of this disorder, beside a pile of garbage being eaten by dogs and shrouded by flies, I arrived at a table of electrical goods. Shops in Kinshasa, especially in this part of town, had moved into the open to escape rents. The vendor was reading a stained small-format magazine, and looking disconsolate. I said I needed a fan. &#x201c;I have a new ventilator,&#x201d; he declared. &#x201c;High quality. I give you the best price.&#x201d; Best price meant there were other prices and I should negotiate. A large pedestaled machine with blue blades was produced.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want Made in China.&#x201d;<br><br>His salesman demeanor vanished. &#x201c;Okay, I know the fan is no good, but you pay only thirty dollars. Made in Japan I have no stock. And why should I? The fans last too long and no one buys again.&#x201d; I relaxed. Now we could talk freely. Outbursts augured well in Congo&#x2014;one only had to expose the initial theater, I found, and people were generally up-front.<br><br>We agreed on the terms of sale, including a one-week guarantee, which the vendor scribbled on the receipt and signed. He meticulously wrapped the fan in cardboard, while I observed the people, the street. Near me danced a stout man, alone, holding a portable radio to his ear; in front of him a butcher massaged a block of meat.</p><h2>Tuning the Rig: A Journey to the Arctic</h2><p>An apprentice seaman recounts his journey in search of humpback whales in the waters near Newfoundland, Labrador, and Greenland, describing how he learned to master a small vessel and handle the dynamics between captain and crew</p><p>The Regina Maris is a white oak barkentine built in 1908, now converted to a training ship for oceanographic research. When he signed on as apprentice, Oxenhorn had romantic expectations about a voyage from Boston to Greenland by way of Newfoundland and Labrador. The object was to study humpback whales. Once under way, however, Oxenhorn became indignant and frustrated by sheer hard work, lack of free time and cramped quarters. Yet when the Regina returned to port 66 days later, he had a totally different perspective on his 29 shipmates and himself. His journal reflects the changes in his attitude and his awareness of his role in society and the environment. There are fine descriptive passages that evoke the desolation of northern seas and poverty in Greenland. Oxenhorn, whose poetry has appeared in the Atlantic and Southern Review , has written a captivating travel-adventure story. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.This is a rather poetic account (indeed in the later chapters we discover the author is a poet) of a voyage via barkentine north from Boston with Greenland its ultimate destination. Aside from a few professionals on board (captain, engineer, and scientists), the crew is amateur. Engagingly written, this features descriptions of sail handling, whales and their habits, much on icebergs, and the areas visited. In essence, it's good reading, and the reader learns a great deal about hitherto unfamiliar subjects. Maps should add to one's comprehension. Recommended in particular for libraries with readers interested in sealore, sailing, and geography.<br><i>- Robert E. Greenfield, formerly with Baltimore Cty.

This new, refreshing, alternative history of maths reveals how simple questions anyone might ask about space in the living room or in some other galaxy have been the hidden engine of science&#39;s highest achievements.</p><p>"How do you know where you are?" asks Leonard Mlodinow in his charming mathematical history, <i>Euclid's Window</i>. This question and others about space and time grew out of simple observations of the environment by a select group of thinkers whose lives and brains Mlodinow dissects. Starting with Euclid, geometry has flowed out over the centuries, describing the universe, and, Mlodinow argues, making modern civilization possible.<p> This is not just a history of geometry--it's a timeline of reason and abstraction, with all the major players present: Euclid, Descartes, Gauss, Einstein, and Witten, each represented by a minibiography. </p><p> Lots of examples pepper the narrative to help readers achieve their own "eureka!" And it's impossible not to be staggered at the mathematical feats of these geniuses, accomplished as many of them were in the absence of anything but observation and intense thought. Each story builds satisfactorily on the last, until at the end of this delightful book, one has a sense of having climbed a peak of understanding.</p><p> A working knowledge of basic geometry is helpful but not essential for enjoying <i>Euclid's Window</i>, and Mlodinow's chatty style lends itself remarkably well to explaining these deep and revolutionary concepts. <i>--Adam Fisher</i></p>Leonard Mlodinow, PhD, was a member of the faculty of the Californian Institute of Technology before moving to Hollywoos to become a writer for televsion.

Abandoned by his parents, brought up by his loving, strict and clearsighted grandmother, Elwood is about to enroll in the local black college.

S. Eliot&#39;s Personal Waste Land: Exorcism of the Demons</h2><p><p>A major reinterpretation, <em>T. S. Eliot's Personal Waste Land: Exorcism of the Demons</em> takes Eliot at his word in his reiterated statements that <em>The Waste Land</em> was not a "criticism of the contemporary world" but a personal "grouse against life." It is the first critical work to investigate in depth the sources of the poem in Eliot's life, with particular attention to Eliot's "Calamus"-like attachment to a French youth during Eliot's graduate year in Paris, his subsequent precipitate (and disastrous) marriage following the death of his young French friend in World War I, and his 1921 nervous breakdown (suffering from what he called "an aboulie and emotional derangement which has been a lifelong affliction") that led to the writing of <em>The Waste Land</em>. Yet the main thrust of this work is not on Eliot's life, but on his poetry, exploring ways in which the fragmentary details of his life shape and illuminate the poems. </p><p>While some consideration is given to the early, confession-like "Ode" (later suppressed), and to the famous "familiar compound ghost" of the later <em>Four Quartets</em>, primary attention is focused on the original drafts of <em>The Waste Land</em>. The poem emerges from a meticulous and detailed reading of the manuscripts as indeed a kind of elegy for a dead friend, with links to Tennyson's <em>In Memoriam</em> and Whitman's "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," and thus not a piece of "social criticism" but an expression of anguish and pain and despair working toward resignation, resolution, and reconciliation. </p><p>It becomes clear that this interpretation is not dependent on biographical conjecture and reconstruction, but flows inevitably from simple close scrutiny of the intricate evolution of <em>The Waste Land</em>; therefore the firm establishment of the full facts of Eliot's early life is unnecessary to this "meaning." In following Eliot's own frequent hints, this book offers a vital corrective to all the previous readings (or misreadings) of <em>The Waste Land</em>, and has important implications for the entire Modernist Movement.</p></p><p><p>James E. Miller Jr. is the Helen A. Regenstein Professor Emeritus of English at the University of Chicago. His most recent book, <em>T. S. Eliot: The Making of an American Poet, 1888&#x2013;1922</em>, was published by Penn State Press in 2005. Miller's other books include <em>The American Quest for a Supreme Fiction: Whitman's Legacy in the Personal Epic </em>(1979) and <em>Leaves of Grass: America's Lyric-Epic of Self and Democracy</em> (1992).</p>&#x201c;James E. Miller, Jr. has accomplished the seemingly impossible&#x2014;given a radically new reading of<i> The Waste Land</i>. The hitherto well-kept secret of Eliot's friendship with Jean Verdenal, the effect of this friendship and of Verdenal's death [at Gallipoli] upon Eliot's attitude to women, its almost disastrous effect on his creativity, the references to Verdenal in <i>The Waste Land </i>and<i> Four Quartets</i>, are here explored for the first time. We may take exception to some of Miller's interpretations, but his facts are incontrovertible. There can be no doubt that <i>The Waste Land </i>is, above all, a personal utterance, as Eliot said it was and Miller shows. Any serious study of this most famous poem, from this time on, will have to take into account <i>T. S. Eliot's Personal Waste Land</i>.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x2014;Louis Simpson<br><br>&#x201c;Any book that honestly attempts to reveal a coherence in Eliot's <i>Waste Land</i> is to be applauded. Basing his findings on the original text, Mr. Miller presents a firm thesis, which will be widely discussed. Whatever be the exact truth, Eliot comes out of it well. In place of a bland know-all throwing off enigmas to baffle ardent disciples, we are invited to watch a tormented soul striving through great poetry towards spiritual self-mastery.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;G.

Nicholas Winters's efforts led to the creation of a device of unknown powers called the Burning Lamp. Each generation of male descendents who inherits it is destined to develop multiple talents-and the curse of madness. <br><br> Plagued by hallucinations and nightmares, notorious crime lord Griffin Winters is convinced he has been struck with the Winters Curse. But even has he arranges a meeting with the mysterious woman Adelaide Pyne, he has no idea how closely their fates are bound, for she holds the missing lamp in her possession. <br><br> But their dangerous psychic experiment makes them the target of forces both inside and outside of the Arcane Society. And though desire strengthens their power, their different lives will keep them apart-if death doesn't take them together.</p><p>Quick is a pseudonym for Jayne Ann Krentz, the author-under various pen names-of more than forty <b>New York Times</b> bestsellers. There are more than 25 million copies of her books in print.If Griffin Winters, one of London&#x2019;s most powerful crime lords, wasn&#x2019;t already going mad, annoying social reformer Adelaide Pyne would certainly drive him crazy. Unfortunately for him, she possesses both the Burning Lamp and the ability to work its dreamlight energy. So if there is any hope of avoiding the &#x201c;Winter&#x2019;s curse,&#x201d; he needs to cut a deal, and the sooner the better. Griffin has already achieved the second of his paranormal gifts, and with the arrival of his third talent comes total descent into madness. But he isn&#x2019;t the only one who wants the Burning Lamp, and if he doesn&#x2019;t find a way to convince the infuriatingly stubborn Adelaide that they need to join forces, both of them could end up dead. A gifted literary alchemist, Quick (Jayne Ann Krentz) continues to perfect her unique recipe for romance in the second installment in her captivating Dreamlight trilogy (Fired Up, 2010) by deftly matching a delightfully sharp-witted and sharp-tongued heroine with a deliciously dark and sexy hero. Quick neatly tempers her paranormal-flavored, danger-infused plot with just the right dash of acerbic humor, and the result is another 24-karat read from one of the genre&#x2019;s best. --John Charles</p><h2>The Key To Everything: Classic Lesbian Love Poems</h2><p>The powerful selection of forty-four classic lesbian love poems in this collection by no means adheres to the simple "love poem" formula.

On the orders of the earl of Clarendon, Chaloner follows the Rev. Richard "Blue Dick" Culmer, who may be connected with political turmoil that threatens the recently restored monarchy, through the streets of London. When a cloaked man stabs Culmer to death on London Bridge, Chaloner tracks the assassin to a church, where he sees the killer confer with other masked men. The villains all get away before the secret agent can identify them. Meanwhile, Chaloner must also figure out why Jane Scarlet, the wife of a junior warden, was raped, and how these violent acts relate to discontent over the Clarendon Code, unpopular restrictions on religious freedom passed by Parliament. A dash of humor complements the fast-paced investigating. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He stomped through the forest, looking neither left nor right, much less where he stepped.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly someone yelled, &#x201c;ï¿½Oye, tï¿½! Watch where you&#x2019;re going! You almost killed me!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seï¿½or Puma stopped in his tracks. He looked for the source of the voice. Down by Seï¿½or Puma&#x2019;s paw was a very annoyed cricket who was shaking his antennae at him. Under normal circumstances Seï¿½or Puma would have laughed and gone on his way, but today he was ripe for picking a fight.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who cares?&#x201d; Seï¿½or Puma said. &#x201c;You are so small and weak that you are good for nothing!&#x201d; With a quick movement of his paw, he flicked Seï¿½or Grillo into the weeds.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seï¿½or Grillo was even angrier than before. He picked himself up and shouted, &#x201c;It is a shame that you should treat me this way. ï¿½Eres un cobarde!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a roar, Seï¿½or Puma yelled, &#x201c;You cannot call me a coward and get away with it! This is war! Prepare your army, and tomorrow we will meet in the meadow near the shore of the lake. I will get rid of you and your kind.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seï¿½or Puma stalked off to recruit his army. Through the forest he went, roaring and calling at the top of his lungs, &#x201c;Come, hermanos, your king calls you to arms!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first volunteers were two bears he spotted among the trees. They were soon joined by two more pumas and five ferocious bobcats. Seï¿½or Puma also enlisted a family of foxes, some skunks, and three nasty snakes. Then he spent the rest of the day drilling his army until they were ready to fight. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Seï¿½or Grillo sat quietly under a tree, thinking about how he could win the upcoming battle. After a while he left to arrange everything.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early the next morning, when the sun was beginning to splash the sky with color, Seï¿½or Puma and his troops arrived at the battleground.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Halt!&#x201d; Seï¿½or Puma ordered, looking over the combat zone.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All was quiet.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only odd thing he spotted were several yellow gourds dotting the field.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seï¿½or Puma snorted and said, &#x201c;Why, the little coward didn&#x2019;t show up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he saw a movement.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seï¿½or Grillo was there after all, standing at the other end of the field.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seï¿½or Puma snickered and said, &#x201c;That silly insect is by himself! Does he think he&#x2019;s going to beat us by throwing gourds? Foolish creature, how can he possibly win? Ha! This is going to be the shortest war in history!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other animals laughed so hard that they fell to the ground, whooping, slithering, and shaking. After a few minutes, they stood up and, still laughing and wiping their eyes, took their positions.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a snarl, Seï¿½or Puma gave the order to begin the battle. The animals howled and rushed at the lone cricket, ready to crush him into the ground.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at that moment, a multitude of crickets jumped up from behind the gourds and whipped off their tops. Seï¿½or Grillo&#x2019;s army poured from the hollow gourds&#x2014;hundreds of angry wasps hovering above his head like a storm cloud.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Seï¿½or Puma saw the buzzing swarm, he skidded to a stop. &#x201c;Run for your lives!&#x201d; he yelled.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All was confusion as the animals in front stopped in their tracks and the ones behind plowed into them. Legs, tails, and bodies jumbled together.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Howling at the tops of their lungs, they untangled themselves and turned tail, running as fast as they could, with Seï¿½or Puma sprinting at the head of his vanquished army.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though they raced as swiftly as possible, tripping over stones and roots and crashing into trees and each other, the wasps soon caught up with them. Seï¿½or Puma shouted, &#x201c;Run to the lake. Only there will we be safe!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as they reached the water, the animals dove into the lake. There they stayed until the wasps decided that they had had enough. Only then did Seï¿½or Puma&#x2019;s army crawl home to lick its wounds.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night Seï¿½or Grillo and his army had a grand party to celebrate their victory. There was food and drink and song, and, as a special treat, Seï¿½or Grillo composed an epic poem narrating their triumph, and then he set it to music on the spot.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then crickets sing that song every night to remember Seï¿½or Grillo&#x2019;s victory over Seï¿½or Puma.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And pumas are very careful not to upset them.</p><h2>Shooting Lincoln: Mathew Brady, Alexander Gardner, and the Race to Photograph the Story of the Century</h2><p><b>They took the most memorable photographs of the Civil War.

Reprint. 200,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Jude Deveraux</b> is the author of 31 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including <i>Wild Orchids, Forever and Always, Forever..., The Mulberry Tree, The Summerhouse,</i> and <i>Temptation.</i> To date there are more than forty-five million copies of her books in print. Jude Deveraux lives in North Carolina with her six-year-old son, Sam.<p><b><i>Chapter One</i></b> </p><p><br> Holly felt as though she'd pulled off the coup of her life -- and by Christmas it would all be settled. After many calls, letters, emails, and promises, she'd finally persuaded her parents to buy Spring Hill Plantation just outside beautiful, historic Edenton in eastern North Carolina. Of course, it hadn't hurt that her stepsister, Taylor, was going to marry a man who lived there. </p><p> Now, she was in the little grocery store that was two miles down the road from the ghastly house her parents had rented last year and she was trying to find something to eat that didn't have a thousand calories a bite. She'd recently lost eleven pounds and she didn't want to put it back on. Facing a summer near her skinny, beautiful stepsister had made her quit eating and go to the gym four nights a week. </p><p> And of course there was the prospect of seeing Lorrie again, she thought. For a moment her eyes glazed over as she remembered him. She was no longer seeing the store, but instead, saw the river and the dock and Lorrie. She'd been thirteen that summer and Lorrie had been sixteen -- a tall, lean, bronzed young man, with golden hair and brown eyes. </p><p> That summer had started out horribly. Her parents nearly always rented a house somewhere for the summer, but until that year the houses had been in communities where their two daughters could swim and meet other people their own age. </p><p> But that summer a friend of her father's had offered them the free use of his beautifully restored old house, built in 1778, located on a river, and set in the midst of four and a half acres of old trees and pretty flower gardens. </p><p> Holly had hated the place at first sight. Its isolation, the remoteness, had made her want to scream. In an instant she'd envisioned a summer in a hell of loneliness. Taylor was old enough to drive so she'd be going to nearby Edenton and joining the real world. </p><p> But what am I to do here the whole summer? she thought, near to tears. Catch tadpoles? Sit by the river and watch the turtles come up for air? It wasn't what a pubescent girl wanted to do. </p><p> She'd tried to persuade her parents that they absolutely, positively could <i>not</i> force her to stay in that horrible place for an entire summer. They'd just smiled, then answered the always-ringing telephone. </p><p> For the first week, Holly had been so bored she thought she might lose her mind. Her parents had already left to fly to London, and Taylor had met a young man. Holly had been left in the charge of a woman who was at least as old as the house and who did little except sleep in the padded swing on the back porch. </p><p> It was at the beginning of the second week that Holly had been sitting on the edge of the pier, her legs tucked up to her chest, and contemplating her family's regret if their youngest child ran away from home, when she heard an unusual noise. She looked up to see a rowboat coming toward her. </p><p> She had to blink, then rub her eyes and blink again to be sure she was seeing correctly. Coming toward her, his back to her, was a beautiful, shirtless young man. She couldn't see his face, but if the front of him was half as good as the back of him, he was an Adonis. </p><p> Holly had stood up, smoothed her shorts and T-shirt -- wishing she weren't wearing her rattiest clothes -- and waited. </p><p> When he reached her dock and turned, he was so beautiful that her breath nearly stopped. </p><p> "Hello," he'd said, throwing a rope at her feet. "I'm Laurence Beaumont and I'm your next-door neighbor. You want to tie that down?" </p><p> She had no idea what he meant. Tie what down? </p><p> "The rope," he said. "Tie it to the cleat." </p><p> It had taken her a moment to understand what he meant. Cleat? Oh, yeah, the thing she used to scrape mud off her shoes. She picked up the rope and tied it in a very neat bow to the metal cleat, then looked over at the young man. </p><p> He looked at the cleat, then back at her, but he didn't laugh. Later, she wondered at that. What other sixteen-year-old would have looked at a boat rope tied into a bow and not howled with laughter? </p><p> But Lorrie hadn't laughed at her, not then, nor at any other time. </p><p> From that first moment, they'd been friends -- kindred souls maybe, since they were so alike. Her name was Hollander, his was Laurence, but they were Holly and Lorrie to everyone. His family had lived in the same house since 1782 and two of his ancestors had signed the Declaration of Independence. </p><p> Holly had some big-shot ancestors on her father's side, and her father himself had been an ambassador to three different countries. "He knows everybody and talks to each one every day on the phone," she'd said under the breath. </p><p> Lorrie had laughed. "My old man makes deals all day." </p><p> "What about your mother?" </p><p> "Died when I was three." </p><p> Holly felt as though she'd been hit in the stomach. Her mother had died when she was one. When she told Lorrie, he sat down on the dock and they began to compare notes of their lives in earnest. </p><p> Both their fathers had been raised in impoverished gentility, with fabulous educations and old-world family names. Both fathers had married heiresses who'd died young. Both men had remarried women with no money. The difference was that Holly's stepmother, Marguerite, was a sort of financial genius, while Lorrie's stepmother's main talent was in spending. Holly's mother's fortune, from Hollander Tools, had increased, while Lorrie's mother's fortune had long ago disappeared. </p><p> "All I have left is the title to the falling-down old house and a few hundred acres," Lorrie had said cheerfully, looking at Holly. "What is it about you, kid, that's making me tell you my life story? I didn't tell my last three girlfriends this much." </p><p> Holly hadn't liked being called "kid," and she didn't like to think that this beautiful young man had ever had a girlfriend, but she took the compliment to her heart. "I guess we were just meant to be together," she said, willing him to take her away forever in his canoe. </p><p> Smiling, Lorrie tousled Holly's short, dark hair. "Maybe so, kid. Maybe you're what I need this summer. Hey! I'll race you to the other side of the river." </p><p> Holly wasn't a very good swimmer, but by the end of that summer she was, for she spent nearly every day with Lorrie. Although Lorrie had revealed lots of secrets about his past, she soon found out that he was close-mouthed about his current life. It was only through listening to the gossip her stepsister so loved that she knew Lorrie was hiding out that summer. </p><p> "The biggest snobs in eastern North Carolina," Taylor had said at dinner. She was talking about the Beaumont family. "They've lived here since George Washington surveyed the area and even have a few letters from him. But seventeen years ago, the family was broke, so Laurence Beaumont the second married some rich little heiress and she conveniently died three years after having Larry the third." </p><p> As always, Taylor had been oblivious to the emotions her careless words caused. Their father had also married an heiress who died young. </p><p> "Lorrie, not Larry," Holly said and immediately wished she could take the words back. Her father, her stepmother, and her stepsister paused to look at her in surprise. </p><p> "The cook works for them sometimes," she muttered, looking down at her food. </p><p> Taylor gave Holly a speculative look before returning to her gossip. Taylor was as gregarious as Holly was quiet. Taylor loved being in a crowd, while Holly wanted just a couple of girlfriends to pal around with. </p><p> Taylor had gone on to say that Lorrie -- "silly nickname for a boy," she'd said -- was supposed to have gone to some elegant summer camp, but at the last minute one of his father's stupid land deals fell through so there was no money. "The kid doesn't want any of his rich friends to know, so he's hiding out at his father's family's rotting old house. Have you seen him?" </p><p> It took Holly a moment to realize her stepsister was talking to her. "Who?" she asked, her heart fluttering wildly. She didn't want anyone to know she was spending most of her time alone with a sixteen-year-old boy. Even though all she was doing was helping Lorrie remove paint off the molding in the old house, she feared that if they knew, they'd stop her. </p><p> "She's been reading the classics, haven't you?" her father said, looking at his only child fondly. Taylor was his wife's daughter. </p><p> Holly looked at her plate and nodded. </p><p> Somehow she managed to keep her secret all summer. Her father and stepmother had flown in and out all that summer; Taylor had spent her time in Edenton, and the woman hired to baby-sit Holly couldn't have cared less where her charge spent the day. </p><p> It had been a magical summer of long, hot days spent with Lorrie. They'd constantly worked together on his family's plantation. His family had lived there since it was built before the American Revolutionary War, and Lorrie loved the place as much as his father hated it. One day while they were painting the dining room, Lorrie told her that his mother had married his father for his name and his home. She'd traded her fortune for the Beaumont history. </p><p> Lorrie's grandfather, shrewd in business, had blessed his daughter's marriage even though he saw what Laurence Beaumont was. However, before the marriage he'd made sure the plantation was given to his daughter's children so that her husband couldn't sell the place. </p><p> "I don't remember her," Lorrie said as she stroked butternut-colored paint onto the clean molding. "But I've been told she loved this house so much that she died for it." He said the last with bitterness. He told Holly that his mother had died giving birth to another child. She'd so wanted to have her baby born in the Beaumont house that, against the doctor's orders, she'd tried for a home birth. There were complications and both mother and child had died before the ambulance could get them to the hospital. </p><p> "Maybe your mother's death is why your father hates this place." </p><p> "Naw. He just loves Tiffany's ass more." </p><p> Tiffany was his father's third wife and Lorrie despised her. She'd made her husband buy her a new, modern house in Raleigh and they stayed there, rarely even visiting the old plantation. </p><p> Holly never asked Lorrie about the camp he was supposed to have gone to. In fact, she didn't ask him about anything that didn't have to do with the house. He took her around to the falling-down outbuildings and told her what they'd been used for. He talked of his dream of someday restoring every building and being "a gentleman farmer," he'd said, smiling. </p><p> "You can do it, Lorrie, I know you can." </p><p> He'd laughed and tousled her hair -- the only way he ever touched her. </p><p> It had been an idyllic summer in spite of the fact that she spent ninety-nine percent of her waking hours and a hundred percent of her sleeping hours imagining Lorrie kissing her. She stared at his lips until she knew every little crease in them. </p><p> If Lorrie had any idea she had a crush on him he never let her know. At the end of the summer she had to go back to school -- this one in Ireland -- and Lorrie had a year of high school to finish. </p><p> When they'd said good-bye, he'd picked her up, twirled her around, and said she was the kid sister he'd never had. Holly'd looked at him and willed him to kiss her. He did, but only on the forehead, then he'd tousled her hair one last time before he got in his car and drove away. </p><p> She'd told him she'd write him and she did. For six months she wrote Lorrie long letters, pouring her heart out to him, telling him of spats at her boarding school and of any accomplishments she was proud of. The only time he'd written back was when she sent him a paper she'd written about Colonial architecture. Lorrie had sent her a postcard that said, "Good work, kid. L." </p><p> It was that summer with Lorrie that sent her on her career path. She decided to study architecture in college, but that soon changed to architectural history, then narrowed to American domestic architecture. </p><p> Over the years his lack of response made her stop sending him letters, but she never lost track of him. She followed his career after he graduated from law school, and she saw how he won nearly every case. She sent him a card of sympathy when she read that his father had shot himself after another bogus land deal had left him impoverished. She cried for three days after she read that Lorrie got married. But Lorrie's marriage had been good for her. It had made her stop living in a fantasy, take her nose out of the books, and begin looking at the men around her. </p><p> She'd grown up to look like her mother, who had won a couple of beauty pageants, so Holly had never had trouble getting men. Over the years she'd had a few love affairs, one serious, but she'd never given her heart away. She'd never told anyone about her summer with the boy next door, but she knew that no man had ever made her feel as Lorrie had. No man had made her feel as though she wanted to say, "Here's my life, take it. Do with me what you will." </p><p> When she turned twenty-one, she came into her inheritance. Millions. After two days of elation and buying new clothes, she decided she had to do something real with the money, something worthwhile. What interested her was the preservation of old houses, but at the same time she didn't want to become one of those rich women real preservationists put up with just for the money. She wanted to be treated as though she had a brain in her head, as though she knew Federal from Colonial from Greek Revival. She decided to get her Ph.D. in American architecture. </p><p> When she turned twenty-four, her father had a mild heart attack and was told to stop jetting all over the world. While Holly was at the hospital, she'd flipped through a <i>Town &amp; Country</i> magazine. It had been two years since she'd read anything outside her subject so she could barely comprehend the magazine. It was when she saw the name Laurence Beaumont III that her eyes began to focus. The article said that Mr. Beaumont had recently divorced and that he was going home to his plantation outside Edenton, North Carolina, to open a law office there. </p><p> Suddenly it was as though everything Holly had ever wanted was within her grasp. She knew she had the money to buy the house next to Lorrie's, but she also instinctively knew that he'd know exactly what she was up to. She'd learned that, to men, the chase was everything. </p><p> As soon as her father was well enough to leave the hospital, she started her campaign to get him -- not her -- to buy Spring Hill, the old house they'd stayed in when she was thirteen. The isolation would allow him the peace he needed, she said. Maybe he could buy a pedal boat and get his exercise by gliding down the river. </p><p> Holly felt guilty about it, but she then led her father into asking her to please spend the summer with them. When he had finally asked, she acted reluctant, until her father said, "If you can't, that's all right," then turned to his wife to change the subject. </p><p> Too loudly, Holly said that maybe the old house would be a good place for her to write her dissertation for her...</p></p><h2>Aqua Fitness</h2><p>Introduces an effective and enjoyable series of no-impact routines that use water&#39;s buoyancy to lessen stress on the heart and joints whil providing a healthful exercise program, in a handbook that features step-by-step full-color photographs.

The book contains animal facts and a mixed-up page at the back for the reader to sort.</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 1-A die-cut peephole and textual clues invite youngsters to guess animals' identities and what young creatures will look like when they mature. In Guess What I Am, the first set of clues suggests a kind of cat with a long, curvy tail and stripy fur that lives in the jungle. The turn of a page reveals a tiger. A great white shark, a beaver, a king penguin, and a fox are also introduced through the peekaboo format. The lack of consistency to the theme, as when a shark's size is compared to cars, is sometimes jarring. In Guess What I'll Be, readers are invited to speculate about the future look of a tadpole, a flamingo chick, a caterpillar, a walrus calf, and a honeybee grub. In both books, scalloped borders cradle double-page spreads of smiling cartoon creatures done in brilliant acrylics. Although both titles make suitable additions for lap-sharing fun, the second book is a surefire winner.<br><i>Gay Lynn Van Vleck, Henrico County Library, Glen Allen, VA</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Best American Poetry 2016 (The Best American Poetry series)</h2><p>The premier anthology of contemporary American poetry continues&#x2014;guest edited this year by award-winning poet Edward Hirsch, a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets and the president of The John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.<br><br>The Best American Poetry series is &#x201c;a vivid snapshot of what a distinguished poet finds exciting, fresh and memorable&#x201d; (Robert Pinsky); a guiding light for the mood and shape of modern American poetry.

Jumpha Lahiri said of Hirsch, &#x201c;The trademarks of his poems are...to be intimate but restrained, to be tender without being sentimental, to witness life without flinching, and above all, to isolate and preserve those details of our existence so often overlooked, so easily forgotten, so essential to our souls.&#x201d; Hirsch&#x2019;s choices for this collection reflect the soul of poetry in America.

Homicide investigator Dave Robicheaux is trying to help Letty Labiche, a New Iberia girl on death row for killing the man who molested her and her sister as children, when chance brings him to Zipper Clum, a pimp and pornographer who recognizes Robicheaux secondhand through a 30-year haze: <blockquote>"Robicheaux, your mama's name was Mae.... Wait, it was Guillory before she married. That was the name she went by ... Mae Guillory. But she was your mama," he said.<p> "What?" I said.</p><p> He wet his lips uncertainly.</p><p> "She dealt cards and still hooked a little bit. Behind a club in Lafourche Parish. This was maybe 1966 or '67," he said.</p><p> Clete's eyes were fixed on my face. "You're in a dangerous area, sperm breath," he said to Zipper.</p><p> "They held her down in a mud puddle. They drowned her," Zipper said.</p></blockquote> To Robicheaux, whose memories of the fun-loving Mae are few and bittersweet, the news comes like a bolt of lightning. Though she abandoned him to the uncertain mercies of a violent, alcoholic father, he loved her, and his desire to find her killers--cops in the pay of the Giacano crime family, according to Clum--is instantaneous and deeply felt. Unfortunately, Zipper Clum meets the wrong end of a .25 automatic soon after his electrifying announcement, but his conversation with his killer is recorded--and Mae Guillory's name comes up again. <p> The winding trail of evidence connected to both Letty Labiche and Mae Guillory leads Robicheaux almost immediately to Jim Gable, the New Orleans Police Department's liaison with city hall, whose position has afforded him a number of less-than-legal advantages. Gable also happens to be an ex-lover of Robicheaux's wife, Bootsie--formerly the widow of Ralph Giacano. From there the web of connections grows ever wider, and (not surprisingly) incriminates those in high places. These include the state attorney general, a woman who, if photographic evidence is to be trusted, was once friendly with the Labiches' parents, who were known procurers.</p><p> But if <i>Purple Cane Road</i> has its share of corrupt powermongers, it's also filled with beautifully rounded characters, like piano-playing governor Belmont Pugh and hit man Johnny Remeta, whose personality slowly begins to unravel as he gets closer to Robicheaux's daughter. The plot converges seamlessly to its climax--the true story of what happened to Mae Robicheaux--as James Lee Burke's trademark of uncompromising justice is brought to fruition. Like Burke's other Robicheaux novels, <i>Purple Cane Road</i> offers a solidly satisfying piece in the picture of a complex hero. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>"America's best novelist."<br>-- <i>The Denver Post</i><br><br>"A thoroughly absorbing mystery packed with the colorful characters and moral dilemmas that have turned Dave Robicheaux into one of the more vivid literary creations of the last 20 years."<br>-- <i>Daily News</i> (New York)<br><br>"Nobody writes about the bad old days down South like James Lee Burke."<br>-- <i>The New York Times</i><br><br>"No other living writer has been more influential on the contemporary crime novel than James Lee Burke....

It begins with a study of the nature of historywriting and the increasing problems involved in utilizing the biblical text for historical reconstruction. The authors suggest an alternative approach which assigns priority to interpreting archaeological data within a broad interdisciplinary framework. The book provides a broad overview of settlement patterns and social relations throughout Palestinian history from the middle of the third millennium BCE to the present day in order to illustrate how the emergence of Israel in the early Iron Age fits into the march of time. Archaeological evidence for the appearance of dispersed settlements in the highlands and steppes of Palestine at the beginning of the early Iron Age followed by the rapid centralization of this area suggests that Israel emerged within Palestine in response to the decline in east Mediterranean trade at the end of the Late Bronze Age. The development of an Israelite monarchy is seen as being inextricably linked to the factors involved in Israel&#39;s emergence-as distinct from much previous research which has presented the monarchy as alien to the origins of Israel. This volume is a reprint of the 1987 edition with a new preface by Robert B. Coote and Keith W. Whitelam setting the work in the context of recent debates on the history of ancient Israel.</p><p></p><h2>General Amin</h2><p>Reports on the revolutionary rise to power, the reign of terror, and the political incompetency of Uganda&#39;s new president</p><p></p><h2>Woodsong</h2><p>For a rugged outdoor man and his family, life in northern Minnesota is a wild experience involving wolves, deer, and the sled dogs that make their way of life possible.

Endowed with a preternatural interest in metaphysics and philosophy, yet as confused as any innocent by the vagaries of adult behavior, little Levi bears the added burden of living in a world that can literally change at the stroke of a pen.<br><br>Aided by a wise pet ("Cat") and a favorite toy ("Bunny"), Levi encounters a frothing ectoplasmic Hegel and a woefully off-the-mark Freud.

Harold is Hal Holbrook&#x20ac;&#x2122;s affecting memoir of growing up behind disguises, and his lifelong search for himself. Abandoned by his mother and father when he was two, Holbrook and his two sisters each commenced their separate journeys of survival. Raised by his powerful grandfather until his death when Holbrook was twelve, Holbrook spent his childhood at boarding schools, visiting his father in an insane asylum, and hoping his mother would suddenly surface in Hollywood. As the Second World War engulfed Europe, Holbrook began acting almost by accident. Thereafter, through war, marriage, and the work of honing his craft, his fear of insanity and his fearlessness in the face of risk were channeled into his discovery that the riskiest path of all&#x20ac;&#x201d;success as an actor&#x20ac;&#x201d;would be his birthright. The climb up that tough, tough mountain was going to be a lonely one. And how he achieved it&#x20ac;</p><p><p>Hal Holbrook is a celebrated actor who has starred in such films as <i>All the President's Men</i>, <i>Wall Street</i>, and <i>The Firm</i>.

Those memories are all so dreamy now, as if none of them ever really happened. I could have dreamed my memories and they would be as real to me. I'm told she was just a young girl and that she left when I was two. I have a picture of her, a little brown-tinted photograph in a gold frame, and she is, indeed, a young girl with a shy smile. But there is some other message in her eyes. Something tired, the eyes of a girl who has had enough and wants it to be over. All I have are two drifting memories of her. The first is on the enclosed porch in the big Cleveland house, green wicker furniture. A baby is stumbling around, knocking into the sharp stub ends of wicker and crying, and a young woman reaches for this baby, but Grandma moves in ahead of her and the baby never gets inside the young woman's arms. That would be me. The other memory is a few years later, in the cigar-scented den off Grandpa's bedroom in the South Weymouth house when I was about six years old. My mother and father have come out of the blue to visit us. They are tap-dancing in the archway of Grandpa's den and she is smiling, but there is no beginning or ending to this memory. It is just a vision, connected to nothing, two young people dancing in limbo. I revisited that house many years later because I was told the people who live there now had sometimes seen the ghost of a young woman with blond hair when they went down into the basement.They were very matter-of-fact about it. They told me I wouldn't feel afraid of her, because she was not threatening. They had a young son, and he agreed. She was friendly, he said. When I descended, I told myself that I would <i>like</i> to see her, that if I could believe in this apparition, I would know my mother. The basement was larger than I had remembered, much larger, so clean and dry, the paint so fresh and shiny after all these years. It stretched away around a corner to the right, where the laundry and shop tools were. To the left was the coal room for the furnace, with the coal chute slanting down into it. It gave me a shock of remembrance, the glistening chute. I remembered crouching there as a little boy. They said she would be in this part of the cellar. That I would probably see her here. I waited. I made myself still, my heart and my body. Did I feel a presence? Was someone there? I wanted her to appear. "Mother?" In my heart I felt a tiny shock. Was it her I felt? Or was it the word I don't remember ever saying that sent a thrill through me? "Hello, Mother. It's me, Harold." I hung on to the feeling as long as I could but finally had to let it go. I don't believe in ghosts. Maybe that had something to do with it, maybe not. I don't know. I would never see her again after she and my father suddenly appeared and danced in the archway of Grandpa's den. Nowadays, at night when I turn out the lights in the living room before going up to bed, I look at her little picture in the gold frame under the lamp where my dear wife has placed it, and I say, "Good night, little girl." She was just a little girl, that's all she was, those years ago when last I saw her. My name is Harold. The year after my mother disappeared for good, they sent me away to boarding school to make a man of me. I was seven years old. The junior school was run by the Headmaster, a short, round man who told stories about a turtle that lived under a rock beside the path to the dining hall. That was his good side. One afternoon I was playing halfback in football practice and I got a shoe full of cleats in the face. Baam! I started to cry. The coach banished me for not being tough enough. I was already in disgrace from the Saturday before, when I caught a pass and ran eighty-eight yards for a touchdown. I couldn't understand why no one was chasing me, until they told me I'd gone the wrong way. I was ashamed. I decided to run a mile. I'd never done it before. Across from the football field was a cinder track--five times around for a mile. I hobbled over there, pulled off my helmet, and drew a line in the cinders. Five times around. No stopping. My football shoes and shoulder pads were pretty heavy, but I didn't think about that right away. Soon I was gulping the fall air of Connecticut and it bit down into my lungs like slivers of ice. By the end of one lap the shoes felt like hunks of pig iron and the shoulder pads were flopping around, banging my ears. "Please, God, don't let me fail! Maybe the Headmaster is watching me up on the hill, from the window in his office, where he likes to punish us. Maybe he will be proud of me if I keep going all the way." Five laps. Now only three and a half. I was beginning to cough up stuff and my lungs were filling up with the ice slivers. Maybe the coach was watching me, too, and he would think, "That Harold has guts, after all. Look at him go." I began to think I was going to make it. A sensation of air spread through my chest, and it seemed to me I could even breathe better. The far turn was coming up again, where those big fall leaves were letting go, and then came the homestretch and I had run four laps. Or was it three? Maybe it was only three. I didn't want to cheat. I could <i>say</i> four, but if it was only three, that would be cheating. They're probably watching me anyway. If I can really make it to a mile without stopping, that will be something big. Very big. My legs were beginning to feel as if they were attached to swivels, and I couldn't see anything past the sweat in my eyes. There was no sound outside my head except the awful gasping that erupted from somewhere in my chest. I yearned to walk a few steps. Just a few. No cheating! Gotta keep moving or it's not <i>running</i> the mile,it's <i>walking</i> it. It's being <i>weak</i>. There's that far turn again, with the harsh smell of brittle autumn leaves. If I can just keep moving until I see that line in the cinders, I will have run the mile. I stopped. There was a great thumping sound in my ears and my eyes were stung shut from the sweat, but I had done it. I had run the mile. It got quiet and I rubbed at my eyes, and when I looked around, I was alone. The football field was empty. Away up the hill I could see the last of the team rounding the corner of the white junior school building, and I could imagine them disappearing into the darkness of the basement, where the Headmaster would be waiting. I would be late. The hill was going to be tough. In winter we built a ski jump on it out of wet snow, so it was steep. There were cement steps along the left side of the hill, under the three big maple trees we climbed when we were playing Tarzan of the Apes. I could go up the steps. But cutting across the slope of the hill was more direct, and that's where I was already heading. Breathe! Lean forward into the hill so you don't fall and roll down it. Maybe the Headmaster won't be waiting in the basement today. It must be adrenaline that keeps you going when you want to stop. Adrenaline or something. I made the hill, and I made the corner of the wooden building where we slept and went to school all year long except for vacations at Thanksgiving and Christmas. And there were the steps, three of them, down into the big, dark space you had to cross before you entered the locker room. And he was there in the dark. Coming out of sunlight into the darkness blinded me, so I couldn't see him. All I heard was a voice. "Holbrook, you're late." The Headmaster was using my last name, not Harold. "Yes, sir. I'm sorry ..." "Come here." "Sir, I was running a mile ..." Whack! Whack! His hand flew out like a whip and lashed the right side of my face and then the left in one smooth, beautiful move. Perfect aim. I tried to get by him toward the locker-room door, but he caught me and drove his knee betweenmy legs. I saw stars. The blow pitched me toward the whitewashed wall of the locker room with all those black hooks on it, and I saw that my head was going to land right between two of them. Clunk! "Get showered." I must have closed my eyes. When I opened them, he was gone. I heard a sob fly out of me and the tears came quick and hot. "If Grandpa knew what you did to me, he would come down from South Weymouth and kill you, kick you, murder you, beat you until the blood spurted out of your nose and ears. You would be dead!" Grandpa would be wearing his big overcoat with the smell of cigar smoke in it and he would pat me on the head and say, "Don't cry, Buddy, we're going home." Then we would walk away and leave the Headmaster dead on the ground. I was not going into that locker room with my eyes red. I was going to let the pink go away first and get my breathing right. Maybe I was only seven, but I was not a sissy. I was not going to walk into that locker room crying, even if my name was Harold. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> The mind flows back. We enter memory, and events and people pour out like little swaying creatures, saying, "Here I am, here I am." The plot is there, the road your life has taken, and those little creatures appear faint and whimsical because you've traveled so far from them. But some of these creatures--certain crippled ones--do not speak out to you. They limp gravely across the past with hard, dead eyes and they stare at you with a question: What do you think of me now? The Headmaster is a crippled figure. After seventy-six years I cannot love him. Something having to do with the awful sorrow of life has helped me forgive other people, and that helps me to forgive myself. But I haven't been able to forgive him. I can see him sitting behind the yellow oak desk in the large classroom after the last class of the day, sitting on a platform slightly above us. It gave his dwarfed height a stature in front of the room full of young boys who waited. We assembled in that classroom before going out to the playing fields, and we waited for our name tobe called out. It meant we were going to be punished. The Headmaster enjoyed this ritual. He played his role like a cat, staring at us for the longest time without blinking. His pale blue eyes and round face were almost expressionless, but not quite. Something was there, a faint emotion. Sometimes it suggested a hint of friendship. Maybe today he wouldn't call out names, he'd tell a little story and we would laugh and feel relief and gratitude. He liked telling little stories. Then he called out a name. "Holbrook." He didn't say the name harshly. It was more like the sound of someone who wanted to share something nice with you. A friendly thing. It meant you had to line up outside his office and be punished. He never told you why. When you entered his office, he would move about quietly in a familiar way. He was not an imposing figure. He was short and rotund and balding, and perhaps he thought of himself as benevolent, a twin version of the mother and father you didn't have. "You know what to do, Harold. Take down your pants." You unbuckled your pants and let them fall. "Both of them." You pulled down your underpants. "Assume the position." You took hold of the arms of a chair that had been neatly placed for you and bent over. Meanwhile, he would be searching in the closet for something. It was a one-by-three flat stick from a packing crate, about three feet long. Probably pine. You waited while he got this stick and then you held your breath while he moved across the room toward you. Whack! Whack! Whack! Three. Whack! Four. Whack! Five. You tried not to cry out, because the boys waiting outside would hear that. Whack! Six. If you cried, he'd stop, but--Whack ! Seven. Am I bleeding? Maybe he'll stop if I cry--Whack! Eight. A sob. Whack! Nine. Tears. Tears. Crying. It's over. He just wanted the sound of crying. "All right, Harold. You can go now. Pull up your pants." Once, when I came out of the room, humiliation blinding me, the piano teacher was waiting down the hall past the line of boys. I'dforgotten about our lesson, and there she was in a doorway, searching my face with her eyes as I got close. Brown eyes, pools of softness. I could tell she had listened to my punishment. She held the door for me, and while I walked over to the piano and sat on the bench, she closed it. Then she sat beside me on a chair pulled up close. There was a pause, an emotional one, while she waited for me to balance myself on the brink of breaking down. I had been learning to play "America" two-handed, and I placed my hands on the keys and tried to remember the first note. Then I started to cry. The piano teacher put her arms around me and held me to her. It was an act of kindness I have remembered all of my life.

Finally, their voyage had ended. As the passengers gathered on deck, Sadie recalled, they marveled at a giant green figure that seemed to rise out of the water. She never forgot "the big woman with the spikes on her head and the lamp that is lighted at night in her hand." Thus, the Statue of Liberty welcomed the newcomers to the United States and, they prayed, to a better life.<br> <br> Although America has always been a land of hope, immigrants have come from different places, at different times, for different reasons. This has led historians to divide immigration into two phases: old and new. The old immigration began in colonial times, more than a century before the United States existed as an independent nation. Over the generations, immigrants came from western and northern Europe: England, Scotland, Ireland, Holland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark. Except for Irish Catholics, most "old" immigrants were of the Protestant faith and could read and write their native language. Despite hardships, these people soon found their place in America.<br> <br> The shift from the old to the new immigration began in the 1880s. While immigrants continued to arrive from the familiar places, a flood of humanity also came from southern and eastern Europe: Italy, Greece, Hungary, Romania, Poland, Russia. By 1910, people from these countries made up seven out of ten immigrants entering the United States, chiefly through New York City. Of these, the vast majority were Italians (mainly Catholic) and Jews from Russia. Because nearly all the victims of the Triangle Fire were from these two groups, we must look at them closely.<br> The Land Time Forgot<br> <br> Educated Americans had always admired Italy as a land of beauty and culture. Each year, thousands of tourists visited its ancient cities--Rome, Florence, Milan, Venice--to see their splendid churches, museums, and art galleries. Music lovers filled the opera houses and concert halls. Yet few Americans realized that Italy was really two countries.<br> <br> Northern Italy, the area tourists favored, was more advanced economically than the southern areas. The nation's industries, banks, and major businesses were based in the north. Since the government was in Rome, the capital, Northerners made the laws, controlled the courts, and commanded the police. For them, the south was little more than an uncivilized colony, an extension of Africa.<br> <br> If you look at a map, you will see that southern Italy forms the heel and toe of the Italian "boot." The boot, in turn, "kicks" Sicily, an Italian island in the Mediterranean Sea. Known as "the land time forgot," the south was a region of small farms and villages that lagged behind the industrial north in all things but la miseria--misery.<br> <br> Misery ruled southern Italy. The majority of its people were among the poorest in Europe. Peasants, or farmers, did not own the land, but worked tiny parcels rented from wealthy landlords, chiefly nobles and northern businessmen. Landlords demanded high rents, so peasants could not afford to buy fertilizer or machinery. Instead, they tilled the soil with hand plows and hoes that were old when their grandparents were children. Peasant families were large and worked together, including children, who were given small chores nearly from the moment they could walk. Youngsters attended school briefly if at all, for they had to help in the fields. Large families lived in tiny, cramped cottages, merely shacks with earthen floors and shared with a prized goat or rooster.<br> <br> Northerners had little respect for southerners, nicknamed "Black Italians" in a racist epithet meant to show their "inferiority"; they called Sicilians "Africans." The government in Rome cheated the south in countless ways. It built no modern roads or bridges there. Instead, it acted like a gigantic straw, sucking out whatever money it could. Heavy taxes collected in the south were spent in the north. Worse, justice was a cruel farce. If wronged by a landlord, a peasant was out of luck. Courts and police served the landlord. This, in turn, made peasants cynical, convinced others acted only for selfish reasons. Proverbs expressed their outrage: "The gallows is for the poor man, the law courts for the fool," "The law works against people," "The fat pig pays no taxes." If one person killed another, the victim's family took justice into its own hands, vowing to "wash blood with blood."<br> <br> Mother Nature herself seemed to turn against the land time forgot. Massive cutting down of forests for firewood and building materials harmed the environment. Without tree roots to hold the soil in place, rain washed away fertile soil, causing crop failures and hunger. Elsewhere, swamps formed. Mosquitos breed in swamps. If a certain species of mosquito bites a person, it may inject a microscopic organism that causes malaria. This disease has killed more people than all history's wars, famines, and natural disasters combined. By the 1880s, malaria had become epidemic in southern Italy.<br> <br> Disasters burst from within the earth, too. In 1905, earthquakes shook the region, collapsing buildings and burying their inhabitants under the rubble. The next year, Mount Vesuvius erupted. Located just east of Naples, this volcano had a fearsome history. An eruption in the year AD 79 buried the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, killing all their inhabitants. The 1906 eruption sent "explosions of red-hot stones" a half mile into the air. "The end of the world has come!" people cried in panic. "The inhabitants of the villages in the vicinity of Mount Vesuvius are in a condition of terror," said the New York Times. <br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Fall Ball</h2><p><p>Bobby and his friends wait all day for school to end and for their chance to play outdoors in the fall weather.

But we do know that, beginning in the 1490s, European monarchs began to claim a right to lands in the &#x201c;New World&#x201d; of the Western Hemisphere. Within a few decades, those rulers sent thousands of soldiers, miners, farmers, and others to bring back precious metals, furs, timber, human slaves, and other goods.<br> <br>We also know that, between 1500 and 1750, the center of economic power in Europe shifted from the southern parts of the continent&#x2014;Italy, Spain, and Portugal&#x2014;to a small island in the North Atlantic comprising England, Scotland, and Wales. The kingdom known as Great Britain after 1707 emerged in that early modern period as a dominant sea power, an imperial colonizer, a global trader, and the leader in factory-based manufacturing. And then in 1776, a major part of Britain&#x2019;s colonial empire seceded, fought a long global war, and achieved political independence.<br> <br>The economic relationship that Anglo-Americans cultivated with Britain during the colonial period proved pivotal. As part of the British empire, white colonial Americans participated in a vibrant, trade-oriented economic system rooted in the exploitation of natural resources and the creation of increasingly sophisticated business forms. After independence, the future of that economic landscape appeared uncertain, and vital debates unfolded about what type of economy the new country should pursue&#x2014;one devoted to export-based agriculture, or one that built on the new manufacturing technologies that Britain had pioneered in the second half of the 18th century? As American politicians sat down to write the Constitution in 1787, these questions created powerful rifts as competing factions argued&#x2014;with far-reaching consequences&#x2014;over the future of business and the legacy of the colonial economy.<br> The World Economy, c. 1500<p></p> <br>To grasp the economic challenges that the first generation of Americans faced when the United States achieved political independence, it is helpful to take the long view of business practices during the period of European colonization. As the major powers of Europe spread their navies and peoples across Africa and the Americas in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, economic life came increasingly to revolve around transatlantic trade.<br> <br>By 1500, intercontinental land-based commerce had flourished across the Eurasian landmass for several hundred years. The expansion of the Arab empire across the Middle East and North Africa, as well as the Moghul Empire in the Indian subcontinent, connected China, India, North Africa, and Eastern Europe. Powerful rulers across that vast geography secured trade routes and reaped significant wealth from the labor of agrarian people. Fabrics&#x2014;silk from the East; wool from colder climates&#x2014;as well as spices, wood, and precious metals all traveled tremendous distances.1<br> <br>Further south, traders from the Arab and Ottoman empires did a brisk overland business with their counterparts in West African kingdoms across the Sahara. In the mid-15th century, seafaring Europeans, particularly from Portugal, began to arrive regularly by ship along the West African coast to trade textiles for goods such as ivory, sugar, and gold. And by the end of that century, such trade regularly included slaves. Portuguese and later Spanish and other European traders purchased captured Africans to work first on sugar plantations they established on the Canary Islands and later, by the first decades of the 16th century, in the Caribbean and South and North America.2<br> <br>Before the 1500s, people in the Americas lay outside these trade networks. The indigenous population of the American continents included vast empires such as the Aztec in present-day Mexico, major city-states such as Cahokia near present-day St. Louis, Missouri, and smaller societies of more mobile and less agriculturally rooted people, particularly near the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North and South America. Trade was extensive within and between the Americas before 1500, but the continents were cut off from the rest of the world. As most students of history know, that situation changed with the advent of European transatlantic voyages in the 1490s, with devastating consequences. In the next three hundred years, a combination of disease, war, and genocide at the hands of European conquerors decimated the native populations of the Caribbean, destroyed empires such as the Incas in Peru, and dramatically affected the number of indigenous people of the eastern woodlands of North America, pushing many inland away from the coast. By the late 16th century, entrepreneurial English businesspeople looked to those &#x201c;abandoned&#x201d; wooded areas along the Atlantic as promising sites for colonies.3<br> <br>The most significant change to the world economy, therefore, was the ascent of European seafaring merchants whose newfound prowess in shipbuilding and navigation allowed them to reach parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas in greater numbers, and to profit immensely in the process. These new trade ventures changed the distribution and settlement patterns of people around the world. But just as important for the development of business and modern capitalism, the &#x201c;Age of Exploration&#x201d; (as the textbooks somewhat cheerfully call this period) also marked a monumental reorganization of the European economy.<br> <br>Historians have traditionally tried to capture the changes in European social, political, and economic life that developed around 1500 in response to increased global trade by suggesting a transition between the earlier &#x201c;medieval&#x201d; period and the subsequent &#x201c;modern&#x201d; (or &#x201c;early modern,&#x201d; to be more precise) period.4 Essentially, what happened was a change from a feudal model of economic organization to a mercantilist model, the forerunner to a capitalist system.<br> <br>As with everything in history, this shift was far more complicated than such a simple claim would suggest. Many people quibble over these terms, since the period of so-called feudalism included such diverse experiences over time and space. Ditto for mercantilism, modern, and, for that matter, capitalism. After all, history is a long-running, continuous process, and human beings never jump from one way of living to a different one overnight. So suggesting a clean break from a &#x201c;feudal&#x201d; past to a &#x201c;capitalist&#x201d; present does injustice to truth. However, if we&#x2019;re taking a long view and accept these concepts as generalities, not rigidly defined systems, this division provides a helpful way of characterizing important changes.<br> <br>When historians use the term feudalism, they are attempting to describe an economic system in which power relations among people formed the building blocks of society. In a classically feudal model (not to be confused with reality), most people worked as farmers (the peasants), giving over their agricultural product to a local ruler (the lord) in exchange for military security. Political power flowed from the strength of these personal connections. The concepts of private property and individual rights did not factor into these arrangements, and most people&#x2019;s socioeconomic status was fixed at birth. Wealth was tied up in the control over land and agricultural production. Trade existed, but not on a massive scale, and most of the agricultural yield was consumed locally.<br> <br>Even within an archetypal feudal society, not everyone lived this way. Off the feudal manors, artisanal craftspeople populated small towns and produced tools, equipment, and clothing for the agricultural system. Artisans typically conducted such manufacturing out of the home and adhered to a strict labor hierarchy: Masters taught their skills to apprentices, who hoped to one day move up to the master level. Guilds&#x2014;organizations of skilled craftspeople&#x2014;regulated the number of up-and-coming apprentices to keep competition low and prices stable.<br> <br>Another key group in medieval towns was the merchants, who exchanged the surplus production from both the farmers and the craftspeople for foreign-made goods. In places such as Italy, traders accumulated significant wealth and many turned into bankers, making their living by guarding other people&#x2019;s money and lending it out, at a price.<br> <br>These town-dwellers&#x2014;manufacturers, shopkeepers, bankers, and traders&#x2014;constituted an important minority in feudal society. Known as &#x201c;burghers,&#x201d; from the Latin word for a fortified dwelling, they constituted a social class distinct from either the landless peasants or the land-owning feudal rulers. When Europe&#x2019;s dominant economic paradigm shifted toward capitalism, they became the core of the bourgeoisie, the property-owning middle class.<br> <br>Europe transitioned away from feudalism in the 15th and 16th centuries. Monarchs in Spain, France, and England grew wealthier through trade, which spread from the Mediterranean to coastal West Africa, and then to the Americas. In the process, they consolidated military power at the expense of local lords. A new economic philosophy that historians call mercantilism gradually took hold, reflecting the conviction that economic activity should bolster the wealth and power of nations. Western European monarchs in particular found new ways to expand, promote, and protect trade, reaping both profits and the political power that came with it. This decidedly unfeudal attitude toward external trade led European powers to business opportunities emerging in the New World.5<br> The Business of Conquest<p></p> <br>The renowned historian Carl Degler famously wrote about America that &#x201c;capitalism came in the first ships.&#x201d;6 His point was that the European conquest of the New World coincided historically with the profound economic changes that produced a recognizably new system that we call capitalism, but the story was quite a bit more complicated, of course. Capitalism did not emerge as a coherent system. It has never achieved that status. As a system of economic organization, capitalism has taken on many forms across time, and exists in a variety of manifestations even today. But even though &#x201c;capitalism&#x201d; defies a simple definition, Degler&#x2019;s notion still stands that major changes in economic organization and business opportunities accompanied the European colonization of the Americas, beginning around the year 1500.<br> <br>Europeans&#x2019; exploration, exploitation, and ultimate inhabitation of the New World was at heart a financial undertaking, enacted in the mercantilist spirit of profit-making for the realm. Just as important as its causes were its consequences: The act of setting up colonies&#x2014;with all the bloodshed, atrocity, and hardship it entailed for native people&#x2014;had long-range consequences for the way European and colonial economies operated. From gold and silver mines in New Spain to fur trapping by the French in present-day Canada to massive sugar, indigo, tobacco, and eventually cotton plantations, European colonizers used the Americas to create new wealth, new types of business, and new ways of thinking about property, profit, and enterprise.<br> <br>For students of American history, it&#x2019;s an old story: ships funded by the Spanish and Portuguese governments began to journey regularly to the Caribbean and South America starting in the 1490s in search of material riches. And, in general, they found them. During the 16th century, Iberian soldiers and merchants traded and stole untold quantities of precious metals, kidnapped natives for sale into slavery in Europe, and established permanent settlements&#x2014;frequently after waging genocidal war on local inhabitants&#x2014;to facilitate this exploitation.7<br> <br>Those initial conquests followed a traditional economic model: Generate wealth by accumulating valuable stuff. At the same time, these mercantilist exploits brought a major economic downside. The huge amounts of silver shipped back to Spain flooded the currency market, sparking a bout of inflation that lasted a century and crippled the Spanish economy. In spite of its large land-holdings in the Americas, Spain would never recover the economic power it wielded in the early 16th century.8<br> <br>By the mid-1500s, a second wave of European voyages to the New World brought merchants from France and England who had motives and strategies similar to those of their Iberian counterparts. With the powerful Spanish and Portuguese empires laying physical claim to lands to the south, early French and English explorers headed north. Given France&#x2019;s superior military and economic position, the French crown began to fund fur-trading outposts along the St. Lawrence River in present-day Quebec.9<br> <br>England, poorer than the major continental kingdoms, showed less interest in establishing Atlantic trading routes until later in the 16th century, by which time political and economic power had shifted away from Spain and Portugal. In the 1570s and 1580s, Queen Elizabeth authorized and underwrote imperial operations first in Ireland and then across the North Atlantic in Nova Scotia, urging explorers to claim lands for the crown and search for precious metals.10 While the quest for riches proved disappointing, these ventures led to permanent colonial establishments. Over the course of the next hundred years, several hundred thousand English people migrated to the New World. Most of those early migrants lived along the Atlantic coast in former Indian towns that had been abandoned during the plague epidemic that forced survivors inland from the coast in the late 16th century.11<br> <br>From the outset, the English colonization of North America was driven by economic imperatives. Although Americans often remember the religious motivations behind that process&#x2014;stressing the story of the Puritans in Massachusetts, for example&#x2014;business opportunities and economic institutions played just as important a role. Just as explorers sailing for Queen Elizabeth had scouted the continent for hidden riches, so, too, did English colonists create more durable communities in the 17th century as part of a larger, transatlantic business venture. In fact, the first two successful English colonies in what would become the United States&#x2014;Virginia (1607) and Massachusetts Bay (1620)&#x2014;were themselves private companies.12 More specifically, each was chartered in the style of a joint-stock company, an early-modern legal entity that grew increasingly important to the global economy during the height of Europe&#x2019;s colonial expansion.<br> <br>Joint-stock companies, the forerunners of today&#x2019;s publicly owned corporations, pooled private sources of capital under the official protection of the crown, funding ventures that were too expensive or risky for an individual person. Drawing on a system of legal contracts developed in Italy centuries earlier, 16th-century English monarchs pioneered the practice of issuing corporate charters that granted an exclusive right to trade in a certain area to a particular group of subjects. In addition to creating a helpful monopoly, these charters created legal entities whose ownership was spread among several inves...</p><h2>Tahiti Sylvain</h2><p>Adolphe Sylvain (1920-1991) stopped off in Tahiti in 1946 and, enchanted by the beautiful landscape, welcoming people, and a certain island beauty who called herself Tehani, decided to stay. He settled in and eventually married his hypnotic lover, working as a correspondent for magazines such as Paris Match, Life, and National Geographic. Drawn by an irrepressible desire to capture his surroundings and to share this lost, unknown world with those outside of it, he dedicated himself to photographing the island's many delights. Like Rousseau and Gauguin before him, he was captive to the people and places of a land so radically different from his own and chose it as his principal subject matter. Sylvain's rich, skilled black-and-white images are like visions of an earthly paradise, peopled with half-clad women wearing flowers in their hair, the sun reflecting off of their glowing skin. His images, capturing the timeless beauty of Tahiti, are a testament to the island's powerful magnetism. <p>After Sylvain's death, his widow Jeanine-Tehani had a dream that a European embarked upon her island country and that she gave to this person all of her husband's photos to be made into a book. In a storybook twist of fate, it just so happened that Tehani's dream became a reality when photographer Gian Paolo Barbieri- born on the same day and hour as Sylvain- stopped off for a visit a few years later. He was mesmerized by Sylvain's photographs and eagerly gathered together his work to take back to Europe. Thus was born Tahiti, woven together by the strands of destiny and the vision of an impassioned photographer. </p><p>Tahiti begins with a preface by Barbieri and an introduction by biographer, journalist, and longtime friend of Sylvain, Jean Lacouture, followed by Sylvain's best works, including landscapes, portraits, and images of celebrities visiting the island (such as Brigitte Bardot, Marlon Brando, and Charles de Gaulle). With these luscious, sensual images as evidence, it's not hard to see why Sylvain was enraptured by Tahiti's exotic, ethereal atmosphere, nor why he felt the need to photograph it. Sylvain's work has not met the success it deserves until now, as fate finally brings his photographs to the world with this retrospective tribute.</p></p><p>Adolphe Sylvain <p>Born in 1920 in Paris. He studied engineering at the Ecole Spï¿½ciale des Travaux publics, was present at the Normandy landing and took part in the liberation of Paris. Demobilised, he rejoined General Leclerc in Indo-China as a war corres- pondent and took film footage for Pathï¿½-Journal. </p><p>In late 1946, he boarded the Grandiï¿½re, the first French war ship to reach the French islands in the Pacific. He went ashore in Tahiti and decided to stay there. He was active in setting up Radio Tahiti, for which he did reportages and sound recordings. Parallel to this, he set up a photo laboratory and worked as a correspondent for Paris Match, Life, National Geographic, Neue Illustrierte etc. </p><p>Adolphe Sylvain also produced and directed numerous documentaries and advertising films.

Her work is celebrated in the art book <em>Playing with Fire</em> (Abrams) and a Bravo TV profile. She previously directed the Academy Awardï¿½-nominated adaptation of William Shakespeare's <em>Titus</em>. She lives in New York. </p>This illustrated screenplay of the forthcoming Frida offers both an array of set photos and quotes from actors, artists, and others involved in Frida's real and dramatized lives, including the artist herself. The screenplay-adapted from Hayden Herrera's Frida: A Biography of Frida Kahlo by an uncredited Edward Norton and others-is the focal point of this book, which is being released in conjunction with the Miramax film starring Salma Hayek. Because the book includes both a foreword by Herrera praising director Taymor's translation of her words and Frida's life to the screen and an explanatory introduction by Taymor herself spelling out the steps she took to re-create Frida's physical and mental worlds, the second introduction by Hayek seems a bit unnecessary, although she was apparently the driving force behind the film. Here, as with Kahlo's world, the visual is paramount, so that the photographs of the actors on set help the reader visualize the script. Excerpts from Herrera's book, as well as from other works about both Kahlo and husband Diego Rivera, help give background to their lives and to the paintings reproduced here.

The accompanying authors&#x2019; comments hint at what is special about the art and enjoin readers to see merit even in the often goofy captions (when discussing a strip about femme fatales, for instance, the authors proclaim, "They don&#x2019;t write dialogue like this anymore: &#x2018;A strange person! Eclipse was her name, and Eclipse her nature!&#x2019; To which Blackhawk replies: &#x2018;And finally she eclipsed&#x2014;herself!&#x2019;"). Striking cover and binding art, coupled with the volume&#x2019;s unusual shape and heft, will attract attention, as will the back cover, which features ads for such staple comic book products as whoopee cushions, boomerangs and model airplanes.

Beautiful spotted coats conceal these elusive cats in their rocky, high-altitude habitat&#x2014;a place where temperatures are often cold enough to freeze human tears. A thick, long tail for balance helps snow leopards spring at their prey from great distances&#x2014;prey that is often three times its own size. Slinking along the Mongolian mountain ridges, the snow leopards are invisible&#x2014;and almost impossible to study.<br> But that doesn&#x2019;t deter scientist Tom McCarthy, Conservation Director of the Seattle-based Snow Leopard Trust, or his many colleagues from dedicating their lives&#x2019; work to the study and protection of this seldom-seen creature. And it doesn&#x2019;t stop Sy Montgomery and Nic Bishop from packing their bags in order to join Tom on a trek to Mongolia, where they hope to learn more about this magical cat, a cat who doesn&#x2019;t give up its secrets easily.<br> It will take endurance and persistence to climb the dusty mountain trails, hope of a snow leopard sighting rising and falling with each new summit. It will take practice and experience to lay humane leghold snares, collect scat samples, and set up motion-triggered cameras. It will take patience, focus&#x2014;and yes, love&#x2014;to dedicate a lifetime learning more about this little-understood creature. But that&#x2019;s the only way the Snow Leopard Trust can protect their charges, before the snow leopard truly becomes nothing but a ghost of the mountain.<br> With a dazzling, as-it-happens narrative and spectacular photographs, Sy Montgomery and Nic Bishop bring Mongolia up close for readers everywhere.</p><p>In addition to researching films, articles, and over twenty books, National Book Award finalist <b>Sy Montgomery </b>has been honored with a Sibert Medal, two Science Book and Film Prizes from the National Association for the Advancement of Science, three honorary degrees, and many other awards.

It has an elegant layout featuring ornamental lettering, watermarks, and gorgeous photos; were it not for the delightfully exuberant text, it would be a stately coffee table book. But kids will giggle about the central role of scat or, as Montgomery often writes, "poo," in the research of snow leopards' habits. Children will be swept up in the buoyant account of the journey through Mongolia led by Tom McCarthy, conservation director of the Snow Leopard Trust, in search of the elusive cat known as the "ghost of the mountain." He has devoted much of his life to studying these animals and persuading their human neighbors of the importance of their survival. Montgomery's enthusiasm translates well to the page and will have readers cheering for the entourage as they attempt to spot a snow leopard. This slender book abounds with information, including stories of McCarthy's rare, powerful past encounters with the cat, as well as zoological and cultural sidebars. Bishop's trademark stunning photography fills out the book with breathtaking views of the extreme environs of Central Asia and warm portraits of the charming people who live there. Author's and photographer's notes aren't typically as engaging as the main text, but the reflections of Montgomery and Bishop on their experiences with McCarthy's crew are eloquent, integral parts of the book. A great way to learn about a spectacular animal and its habitat.&#x2014;<i>Alyson Low, Fayetteville Public Library, AR</i> END</p><h2>War Plan Red: The United States&#39; Secret Plan to Invade Canada and Canada&#39;s Secret Plan to Invade the United States</h2><p>It's known as the world's friendliest border.

Launching into a chronological account of the evolution of the iron horse, subsequent pages highlight major developments in (mostly American) railroad history, from the first steam engines to run on rails to the high-speed trains of Europe and Asia. Flatly styled and employing limited color palettes, several of Curlee's acrylic paintings will impress and awe readers with ground-up perspectives of trains set against broad expanses of sky or mountain ranges and sometimes put into historical context with people in the foreground. The author leaves readers to ponder whether modern trains, more efficient than their predecessors, may offer a highway into the future for a nation built by the railroads.

Morrison Series in Southern Studies)</h2><p>This richly illustrated portrait of North Carolina's pottery traditions tells the story of the generations of "turners and burners" whose creations are much admired for their strength and beauty. Perhaps no other state possesses such an active and extensive ceramic heritage, and one that is entirely continuous. This book is an attempt to understand both the past and the present, the now largely vanished world of the folk potter and the continuing achievements of his descendants. It is a tribute that is long overdue.<br><br>From the middle of the eighteenth century through the second quarter of the twentieth century, folk potters in North Carolina produced thousands of pieces of earthenware and stoneware -- sturdy, simple, indispensable forms like jars and jugs, milk crocks and butter churns, pitchers and dishes, ring jugs and flowerpots. Their wares were familiar and everyday, not innovative or unusual, because they were shaped through generations of use for specific functions. The utilitarian forms were so commonplace and embedded in daily life that few individuals documented the craft. <i>Turners and Burners</i> is the first book to chronicle these pottery traditions, with close attention to distinct regional and temporal patterns and the major families involved. It explores in detail the traditional technologies used, from the foot-powered treadle wheel to the wood-fired groundhog kiln.<br><br>Terry Zug became interested in North Carolina pottery in 1969 shortly after moving to Chapel Hill. In 1974 he began documenting the craft and traveled throughout the state recording the reminiscences of potters, former potters, and members of potters' families who recalled the old craft in remarkable detail. He systematically photographed and cataloged old pots, located early shop sites, and carefully recorded the remaining waster dumps of broken shards and decaying equipment. His primary source, however, was the potters themselves. Their tape-recorded interviews provide an insider's view of their world and reveal the powerful underlying logic and autonomy of their craft.<br><br></p><p>"The best book I have ever read on folk pottery."--Warren E.

In this fun and thought-provoking book, historian and animal enthusiast Boria Sax argues for a classification of animals that goes beyond the biological to encompass a more meaningful distinction: tradition. From ants and elephants to tigers and tortoises, The Mythical Zoo weaves together a crosscultural tapestry encompassing mythology, history, art, science, philosophy, and literature. The result is a beautifully illustrated, masterfully composed love letter to the animal kingdom.</p><p><p>Thought in the past to be divine, animals have played an active role in human culture since prehistoric times. Sometimes domesticated, never conquered, and serving as both prey and predator, animals are an integral part of the human experience. Even today, animals wield symbolic powers as varied as the cultures that embrace them.</p>Boria Sax is the award-winning author of City of Ravens and Animals of the Third Reich. His books have been translated into eight languages.

In this careful and insightful commentary on Isaiah, Goldingay unfolds the voices and messages of those prophetic actions and experiences. While doing this he points out that three attributes of Yahweh come into distinctive focus in Isaiah: Yahwehï¿½&#x2019;s majesty and authority, Yahwehï¿½&#x2019;s passion in anger and compassion, and Yahwehï¿½&#x2019;s insight and capacity to formulate a plan and put it into effect. Goldingay also examines the way Isaiah thinks about the people of God and the relationship between the vision of who they could be, the reality of who they were, the calamity of that contrast, and ultimately the promise Yahweh offers to them.</p><p>Expert help for understanding the Bible<br><br>Each volume in the Understanding the Bible Commentary Series breaks down the barriers between the ancient and modern worlds so that the power and meaning of the biblical texts become transparent to contemporary readers.

And this is the question at the heart of Katherine Benton-Cohen&#x2019;s provocative history, which ties that seemingly remote corner of the country to one of America&#x2019;s central concerns: the historical creation of racial boundaries. </p><p> </p><p> It was in Cochise County that the Earps and Clantons fought, Geronimo surrendered, and Wheeler led the infamous Bisbee Deportation, and it is where private militias patrol for undocumented migrants today. These dramatic events animate the rich story of the Arizona borderlands, where people of nearly every nationality&#x2014;drawn by &#x201c;free&#x201d; land or by jobs in the copper mines&#x2014;grappled with questions of race and national identity. Benton-Cohen explores the daily lives and shifting racial boundaries between groups as disparate as Apache resistance fighters, Chinese merchants, Mexican-American homesteaders, Midwestern dry farmers, Mormon polygamists, Serbian miners, New York mine managers, and Anglo women reformers. </p><p> </p><p> Racial categories once blurry grew sharper as industrial mining dominated the region. Ideas about home, family, work and wages, manhood and womanhood all shaped how people thought about race. Mexicans were legally white, but were they suitable marriage partners for &#x201c;Americans&#x201d;? Why were Italian miners described as living &#x201c;as no white man can&#x201d;? By showing the multiple possibilities for racial meanings in America, Benton-Cohen&#x2019;s insightful and informative work challenges our assumptions about race and national identity. </p></p><p>Katherine Benton-Cohen is Associate Professor of History, Georgetown University.In a beautifully written book, Benton-Cohen provides a compelling exploration of race in the Arizona borderlands. She has a talent for grabbing readers' attention, for assembling a fascinating cast of characters--ranging from Geronimo to Felix Frankfurter--and for heightening the anticipation of her audience. Her descriptions of small towns are as lively as her accounts of nasty labor conflicts, and I was so eager to find out what she had to say about the Bisbee Deportation that I found the book hard to put down. (Peggy Pascoe, author of <i>What Comes Naturally: Miscegenation Law and the Making of Race in America</i>)<br><br>Combining the remarkable investigative talents of an ace sleuth with the lucid prose of an accomplished storyteller, Katherine Benton-Cohen shows how a deceptively simple question--who is an American?--shaped everyday life for the polyglot peoples of Arizona's Cochise County. Especially insightful, and particularly troubling, is her account of the hardening of racial categories along the U.S.-Mexican border. Anyone who cares about the historical origins of contemporary debates about race, immigration, and power will need to reckon with the stories of the "borderline Americans" whose lives Benton-Cohen reconstructs with such grace and compassion. (Thomas G. Andrews, author of <i>Killing for Coal: America's Deadliest Labor War</i>)<br><br>The Arizona-Sonora borderland is a messy, volatile place where American authorities have worked hard to draw neat, static lines.

(Virginia Scharff, author of <i>Twenty Thousand Roads: Women, Movement, and the American West</i>)<br><br>Benton-Cohen has crafted a jewel of social history, the most insightful local study I have read in years.

(Michael Kazin, author of <i>A Godly Hero: The Life of William Jennings Bryan</i>)<br><br>Benton-Cohen uses the backdrop of the Wild West, with its bustling commerce and growing population, to wage a discussion on racial division and the power of "white privilege"--even where the black-white dichotomy didn't necessarily exist--in this richly detailed anthropological look into the creation of racial boundaries and their application in present-day immigration reform debates.

She went on to earn a B.A. from Newtown College of the Sacred Heart (Boston College) and a M.L.S. from Simmons&#x2019; Graduate School of Library and Information Science.

Ernie lives in New York City's Chinatown, where traditions are rooted in the culture of southern China. Ernie's father, a kung fu master, choreographs The Lion Dance, the center of the community celebration and a major tourist attraction. This year, Ernie dances in the place of honor under the lion's head. Color photographs depict private and public festivities. Brown's Chinese New Year (Holt, 1987), reported in third person, gives more general information about Chinese traditions. Set in San Francisco's Chinatown and portraying the same regional customs in black-and-white photographs, Brown's book explains how the date for New Year is determined (something Lion Dancer never mentions) and emphasizes the variety of ways in which Chinese people celebrate this all-important holiday. Both books include a chart of the 12-year Chinese zodiac; Lion Dancer adds a horoscope for each of the animal signs. Hou-Tien Cheng's The Chinese New Year (Holt, 1976) tells how the holiday is celebrated in China. Brown's book remains the best overall introduction to the Chinese-American celebration, with Lion Dancer a strong supplement for its immediacy, its vibrant color, and its sympathetic look at a Chinese family. --Margaret A.

With only a few thousand men from all branches of the service, including mountain troopers, elderly reservists, police officers, navy drivers, SS partisan hunters and supply troops, Generalmajor Theodor Scherer was ordered to hold Cholm in the face of a superior enemy force. That Scherer and his men prevailed is now an historical fact but analysis of daily radio traffic and combat reports reveals that the pocket s survival was precarious; at times, even senior commanders doubted if it could be saved. On several occasions the Soviet onslaught looked poised to inflict the death blow but somehow the exhausted men of Cholm grimly clung to a few resistance nests upon which a new line was anchored. General Scherer, a popular leader and inspiration to all his soldiers, despaired many times and was forced to continually plead for more men, more supplies and more aerial support. Urgent demands by other sectors meant Kampfgruppe Scherer was drip-fed just enough supplies and reinforcements to stay alive until, eventually, a relief force forged a permanent link and freed the exhausted survivors. <p>After a catastrophic winter of setbacks and resounding defeats for the Wehrmacht, the General and his men were lauded as heroes and recognised with an arm shield that marked them as Cholmkï¿½mpfer, men of exceptional courage who had prevailed despite overwhelming odds. </p><p>Primary sources have been utilised for the first time to present this battle in a detailed day-by-day format, from the forlorn days of January and February to liberation in early May. </p><p>608 pages on a high-quality gloss stock <br>328 photos <br>22 maps and sketches <br>22 aerial photos <br>9 supporting documents <br>7 detailed appendices</p></p><p></p><h2>Elie Saab (Legends)</h2><p><br>The designer magnifies femininity, building his fairy-tale creations with simple designs, the finest materials, delicate hand-embroidery, intricate detail, and a sophisticated fusion of cultural influences.

Now she is ten years old and feels just grown up enough for her first big adventure. Emily will leave her family behind in England and travel the sea and across a continent to Zion, her new home in America. But Emily will discover that big adventures can leave you feeling small all over again. And sometimes you need a friend to help you get home. Author Ruth Hailstone based Emily&#39;s story on family accounts.

He has illustrated a number of books for young readers, including <i>Pirates, </i>a collection of poems by David L. Harrison.</p>In 1863, 10-year-old Emily joins two fellow English Mormons headed for Salt Lake City, Utah. The story is framed with the journey&#x2019;s difficulties, including a measles epidemic aboard ship and an exhausting cross-country trek following a wagon train. Just when she loses hope, a white ox appears, and caring for him enables Emily to go on. Based on Hailstone&#x2019;s great-great-grandmother&#x2019;s account of immigrating to America, this family story is encumbered by the necessity of covering a long span of time and distance within a picture book. Still, the tale has heft as well as heart, and the telling makes it real through details of the journey, from the green scum on the ship&#x2019;s drinking water to the cowhide pouch in which Emily stows buffalo chips and kindling wood picked up along the trail. Dramatic and often beautiful, the double-page paintings also bring the characters and settings to life.

We moved by each other, ships passing without fanfare the way hundreds of strangers pass every day. The moment didn't last longer than it took to see a bush of dark, messy hair and a flash of dark eyes. I registered his clothes first, the khaki cargo pants and a long-sleeved black T-shirt. Then his height and the breadth of his shoulders. I became aware of him in the span of a few seconds the way men and women have of noticing each other, and I swiveled on the pointed toe of my kitten-heel pumps and followed him with my gaze until the door of the Speckled Toad closed behind me.<br><br>"Want me to wait?"<br><br>"Huh?" I looked at Kira, who'd gone ahead of me. "For what?"<br><br>"For you to go back after the dude who just gave you whiplash." She smirked and gestured, but I couldn't see him anymore, not even through the glass.<br><br>I'd known Kira since tenth grade, when we bonded over our mutual love for a senior boy named Todd Browning. We'd had a lot in common back then. Bad hair, miserable taste in clothes and a fondness for too much black eyeliner. We'd been friends back then, but I wasn't sure what to call her now.<br><br>I turned toward the center of the shop. "Shut up. I barely noticed him."<br><br>"If you say so." Kira tended to drift, and now she wandered toward a shelf of knickknacks that were nothing like anything I'd ever buy. She lifted one, a stuffed frog holding a heart in its feet. The heart had MOM embroidered on it in sparkly letters. "What about this?"<br><br>"Nice bling. But no, on so many levels. I do have half a mind to get her one of these, though." I turned to a shelf of porcelain clowns.<br><br>"Jesus. She'd hate one of those. I dare you to buy it." Kira snorted laughter.<br><br>I laughed, too. I was trying to find a birthday present for my father's wife. The woman wouldn't own her real age and insisted every birthday be celebrated as her "twenty-ninth" along with the appropriate coy smirks, but she sure didn't mind raking in the loot. Nothing I bought would impress her, and yet I was unrelentingly determined to buy her something perfect.<br><br>"If they weren't so expensive, I might think about it. She collects that Limoges stuff. Who knows? She might really dig a ceramic clown." I touched the umbrella of one tightrope-balancing monstrosity.<br><br>Kira had met Stella a handful of times and neither had been impressed with the other. "Yeah, right. I'm going to check out the magazines."<br><br>I murmured a reply and kept up my search. Miriam Levy, the owner of the Speckled Toad, stocks an array of decorative items, but that wasn't really why I was there. I could have gone anyplace to find Stella a present. Hell, she'd have loved a gift card to Neiman Marcus, even if she'd have sniffed at the amount I could afford. I didn't come to Miriam's shop for the porcelain clowns, or even because it was a convenient half a block from Riverview Manor, where I lived.<br><br>No. I came to Miriam's shop for the paper.<br><br>Parchment, hand-cut greeting cards, notebooks, pads of exquisite, delicate paper thin as tissue, stationery meant for fountain pens and thick, sturdy cardboard capable of enduring any torture. Paper in all colors and sizes, each individually perfect and unique, just right for writing love notes and breakup letters and condolences and poetry, with not a single box of plain white computer printer paper to be found. Miriam won't stock anything so plebian.<br><br>I have a bit of a stationery fetish. I collect paper, pens, note cards. Set me loose in an office-supply store and I can spend more hours and money than most women can drop on shoes. I love the way good ink smells on expensive paper. I love the way a heavy, linen note card feels in my fingers. Most of all, I love the way a blank sheet of paper looks when it's waiting to be written on. Anything can happen in those moments before you put pen to paper.<br><br>The best part about the Speckled Toad is that Miriam sells her paper by the sheet as well as by the package and the ream. My collection of papers includes some of creamy linen with watermarks, some handmade from flower pulp, some note cards scissored into scherenschnitte scenes. I have pens of every color and weight, most of them inexpensive but with something&#x2014;the ink or the color&#x2014;that appealed to me. I've collected my paper and my pens for years from antique shops, close-out bins, thrift shops. Discovering the Speckled Toad was like finding my own personal nirvana.<br><br>I always intend to use what I buy for something important. Worthwhile. Love letters written with a pen that curves into my palm just so and tied with crimson ribbon, sealed with scarlet wax. I buy them, I love them, but I hardly ever write on them. Even anonymous love letters need a recipient... and I didn't have a lover.<br><br>Then again, who writes anymore? Cell phones, instant messaging and the Internet have made letter writing obsolete, or nearly so. There's something powerful, though, about a handwritten note. Something personal and aching to be profound. Something more than a half-scribbled grocery list or a scrawled signature on apremade greeting card. Something I would probably never write, I thought as I ran my fingers over the silken edge of a pad of Victorian-embossed writing paper.<br><br>"Hey, Paige. How's it going?" Miriam's grandson Ari shifted the packages in his arms to the floor behind the counter, then disappeared and popped back up like a jack-in-the-box.<br><br>"Ari, dear. I have another delivery for you." Miriam appeared from the curtained doorway behind the front counter and looked over her half-glasses at him. "Right away. Don't take two hours like you did the last time."<br><br>He rolled his eyes but took the envelope from her and kissed her cheek. "Yes, Bubbe."<br><br>"Good boy. Now, Paige. What can I do for you today?" Miriam watched him go with a fond smile before turning to me. She was impeccably made up as usual, not a hair out of place or a smudge to her lipstick. Miriam is a true grande dame, at least seventy, and with a style few women can pull off at any age.<br><br>"I need a gift for my father's wife."<br><br>"Ah." Miriam inclined her head delicately to the left. "I'm sure you'll find the perfect gift. But if you need any help, let me know."<br><br>"Thanks." I'd been in often enough for her to know I liked to wander and browse.<br><br>After twenty minutes in which I'd caressed and perused the new shipment of fine writing papers and expensive pens I couldn't afford no matter how much I desperately wanted one, Kira found me in the back room.<br><br>"Okay, Indiana Jones, what are you looking for? The Lost Ark?"<br><br>"I'll know it when I see it." I gave her a look.<br><br>Kira rolled her eyes. "Oh, let's just go to the mall. You know Stella won't care what you give her."<br><br>"But I care." I couldn't explain how important it was to... well, not impress Stella. I could never impress her. To not disappoint her. To not prove her right about me. That was all I wanted to do. To not prove her right.<br><br>"You're so stubborn sometimes."<br><br>"It's called determination," I murmured as I looked one last time at the shelf in front of me.<br><br>"It's called stubborn as hell and refusing to admit it. I'll be outside."<br><br>I barely glanced up as she left. I'd known Kira's attention span wouldn't make her the best companion for this trip, but I'd put off buying Stella's gift for too long. I hadn't seen much of Kira since I'd moved away from our hometown to Harris-burg. Actually, I hadn't seen much of her even before that. When she'd called to see if I wanted to get together I hadn't been able to think of a reason to say no that wouldn't make me sound like a total douche. She'd be content outside smoking a cigarette or two, so I turned my attention back to the search, determined to find just the right thing.<br><br>Over the years I'd discovered it wasn't necessarily the gift itself that won Stella's approval, but something even less tangible than the price. My father gave her everything she wanted, and what she didn't get from him she bought for herself, so buying her something she wanted or needed was impossible. Gretchen and Steve, my dad's kids with his first wife, Tara, took the lazy route of having their kids make her something like a finger-painted card. Stella's own two boys were still young enough not to care. My half siblings got off the gift-giving hook with their haphazard efforts when I'd be held to a higher standard.<br><br>There is always something to be gained from being held to the higher standard.<br><br>Now I looked, hard, thinking about what would be just right. Don't get me wrong. She's not a bad person, my father's wife. She never went out of her way to make me part of their family the way she had with Gretchen and Steven, and I surely didn't rank as high in her sight as her sons Jeremy and Tyler. But my half siblings had all lived with my dad. I never had.<br><br>Then I saw it. The perfect gift. I took the box from the shelf and opened the top. Inside, nestled on deep blue tissue paper, lay a package of pale blue note cards. In the lower right corner of each glittered a stylized <em>S </em>surrounded by a design of subtly sparkling stars. The envelopes had the same starry design, the paper woven with silver threads to make it shine. A pen rested inside the box, too. I took it out. It was too light and the tiny tassel at the end made it too casual, but this wasn't for me. It was the perfect pen for salon-manicured fingers writing thank-you cards in which all the t's were dotted by tiny hearts. It was the perfect pen for Stella.<br><br>"Ah, so you found something." Miriam took the box from me and carefully peeled away the price sticker from beneath. "Very nice choice. I'm sure she'll love it."<br><br>"I hope so." I thought she would, too, but didn't want to jinx myself.<br><br>"You always know exactly what someone needs, don't you?" Miriam smiled as she slipped the box into a pretty bag and added a ribbon, no extra charge.<br><br>I laughed. "Oh, I don't know about that."<br><br>"You do," she said firmly. "I remember my customers, you know. I pay attention. There are many who come in here looking for something and don't find it. You always do."<br><br>"That doesn't mean it's the right thing," I told her, paying for the cards with a pair of crisp bills fresh out of the ATM.<br><br>Miriam gave me a look over her glasses. "Isn't it?"<br><br>I didn't answer. How does anyone know if they know what they're doing is right? Until it's too late to change things, anyway.<br><br>"Sometimes, Paige, we think we know very well what someone wants, or needs. But then&#x2014;" she sighed, holding out a package of pretty stationery in a box with a clear plastic lid "&#x2014;we discover we are wrong. I'd put this aside for one of my regular customers, but he didn't care for it, after all."<br><br>"Too bad. I'm sure someone else will." I wasn't surprised a man didn't want the paper. Embossed with gilt-edged flowers, it seemed a little too feminine for a dude.<br><br>Miriam's gaze sharpened. "You, perhaps?"<br><br>I waved the flowered paper aside and shoved my hands in my back pockets as I looked around the shop. "Not really my style."<br><br>She laughed and set the box aside. She'd painted her nails scarlet to match her lipstick. I hoped when I was her age I'd be half as stylish. Hell. I hoped to be half as stylish tomorrow.<br><br>"Now, how about something for yourself? I have some new notebooks right here. Suede finish. Gilt-edged pages. Tied closed with a ribbon," she wheedled, pointing to the end-cap display. "Come and see."<br><br>I groaned good-naturedly. "You're heartless, you know that? You know all you have to do is show me...oh. Ohhh."<br><br>"Pretty, yes?"<br><br>"Yes." I wasn't looking at notebooks, but at a red, lacquered box with a ribbon-hinged lid. A purple-and-blue dragonfly design etched the polished wood. "What's this?"<br><br>I stroked the smooth lid and opened it. Inside, nestled on black satin, rested a small clay dish, a small container of red ink and a set of wood-handled brushes.<br><br>"Oh, that's a calligraphy set." Miriam came around the counter to look at it with me. "Chinese. But this one is special. It comes with paper and a set of pens, not just brushes and ink."<br><br>She showed me by lifting the box's bottom to reveal a sheaf of paper crisscrossed with a crimson ribbon and a set of brass-nibbed pens in a red satin bag with a drawstring.<br><br>"It's gorgeous." I took my hands away, though I wanted to touch the pens, the ink, the paper.<br><br>"Just what you need, yes?" Miriam went around the counter to sit on her stool. "Perfect for you."<br><br>I checked the price and closed the box's lid firmly. "Yes. But not today."<br><br>"No?" Miriam tutted. "Why is it you know so well what everyone else needs, but not yourself? Such a shame, Paige. You should buy it."<br><br>I could pay my cell phone bill for the price of that box. I shook my head, then cocked it to look at her. "Why are you so convinced I know what everyone else needs? That's a pretty broad statement."<br><br>Miriam tore the wrapper off a package of mints and put one into her mouth. She sucked gently for a moment before answering. "You've been a good customer. I've seen you buy gifts, and sometimes things for yourself. I like to think I know people. What they need and like. Why do you think I have such atrocities on my shelves? Because people want them."<br><br>I followed her gaze to the shelf holding more porcelain clowns. "Just because you want something doesn't mean you should have it."<br><br>"Just because you want something doesn't mean you should deny yourself the pleasure," Miriam said serenely. "Buy yourself that box. You deserve it."<br><br>"I have nothing to write with it!"<br><br>"Letters to a sweetheart," she suggested.<br><br>"I don't have a sweetheart." I shook my head again. "Sorry, Miriam. Can't do it now. Maybe some other time."<br><br>She sighed. "Fine, fine. Deny yourself the pleasure of something pretty. You think that's what you need?"<br><br>"I think I need to pay my bills before I can buy luxuries, that's what I think."<br><br>"Ah. Sensible." She inclined her head. "Practical. Not very romantic. That's you."<br><br>"You can tell all that from the kind of paper I buy?" I put my hands on my hips to stare at her. "C'mon."<br><br></p><h2>Bashan and I (Pine Street Books)</h2><p><p><i>Bashan and I</i> is the moving story of Thomas Mann's relationship with his spirited German short-haired pointer. From their first encounter at a local farm, Mann reveals how he slowly grows to love this energetic, loyal, and intelligent animal. Taking daily walks in the nearby parkland, Mann begins to understand and appreciate Bashan as a living being, witnessing his native delight in chasing rabbits, deer, and squirrels along with his careful investigations of stones, fallen branches, and clumps of wet leaves. As their bond deepens, Mann is led to contemplate Bashan's inner life, and marvels at the ease with which his dog trusts him, completely putting his life into his master's hands.</p><p>Over time, the two develop a deep mutual understanding, but for Mann, there is always a sense of loss at never being able to enter the private world of his dear friend, and he slowly becomes conscious of the eternal divide between mankind and the rest of nature. Nonetheless, the unique relationship quietly moves to the forefront of Mann's life, and when master and companion are briefly separated, Mann is taken aback by the depth of his loneliness without his dog. It is this deep affection for another living creature that helps the writer to reach a newfound understanding of the nature of love, in all its complexity.</p><p>First published in 1916 and translated into English in 1923, <i>Bashan and I</i> was heralded for its simple telling of how a dog became a priceless companion, an animal who brought meaning to the author's life.</p></p><p>Thomas Mann (1875-1955), author of many novels and stories, including Magic Mountain, Death in Venice, Buddenbrooks, and Doctor Faustus, received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1929.

Once aboard, the two begin to establish separate social circles in order to keep an eye on as many passengers and crew as possible. As the ship gets underway it's smooth sailing, and George and Genevieve are hoping that perhaps this will be their first uneventful cruise. <br><br>Unfortunately, their luck turns quickly as a fiery Catholic missionary is murdered in what proves to be the first of a series of crimes that will stretch them to their limit. Dillman and Genevieve have to use all their skills to combat danger on more than one front, and to prevent an otherwise idyllic (and romantic) trip from becoming a terrifying nightmare. <br><br>As fans of Conrad Allen and his nautical adventures have come to expect, Murder on the Minnesota packs another fast-paced, exhilarating mystery into the exquisitely rendered world of romance and suspense aboard the majestic ocean liners of the early 20th century. <br></p><p><b>Conrad Allen</b> is the author of two previous mysteries in this series, <i>Murder on the Lusitania and Murder on the Mauretania</i>. He lives in England.<br><b>Murder on the Minnesota</b><br><b>ONE</b>MAY 1908&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>T</b>hey were being driven along Fifth Avenue in a hansom when he broke the news to her. Genevieve Masefield sensed that he had something important to divulge but she did not press him. One of the first things she had learned about George Porter Dillman was that he could not be rushed. He liked to take his time. Accordingly, their conversation moved at the same leisurely pace as the cab. With the sun glinting off its harness, the bay mare pulled them along at a gentle and unvarying trot. Genevieve peeped out from under the broad brim of her straw hat to admire the mansions they passed and to enjoy her fleeting fantasies of ownership."I like that one," she decided, pointing a finger."You have good taste, Genevieve.""It's such a gracious house.""I agree," he said, "but it would come at a gracious price."She gave a sigh. "There's always a catch."They made a handsome couple. The tall, slim, elegant Dillman was immaculate in a pale gray suit, his straw boater angled to display his striking features to the best advantage. Genevieve wore a dress of white lace and a pair of white lace gloves. Aslender young woman with a natural beauty, she exuded a sense of good breeding that was at variance with her origin as the daughter of a London draper. Each complemented the other. Anyone seeing them together would assume from their easy familiarity that they had known each other for a long time. In fact, Dillman had met her only nine months earlier on the maiden voyage of the <i>Lusitania</i>. It had turned out to be a fateful encounter.The hansom rolled on through the traffic until it reached the Flatiron Building. Genevieve sat forward and craned her neck to look up at what was reputedly the tallest building in the world. When they came to the point where Fifth Avenue and Broadway merged, she gaped afresh at an imperial edifice of red brick, white tile, and terra cotta."What's that, George?""Madison Square Garden.""It's enormous!""Oh, we have bigger buildings than that in New York.""It looks so <i>foreign</i>.""The Spanish influence. Inspired by Seville, I'm told.""Look at that tower. It could have come from a cathedral.""Well, I guess that Madison Square Garden is a cathedral of sorts," he observed dryly. "The tower is almost three hundred and fifty feet high. It was the architect's crowning achievement.""He must be so proud of it.""He would be, Genevieve, if he were still alive. Unfortunately, he was shot dead in the Roof Garden restaurant."Genevieve was shocked. "He was murdered?""Yes," he explained, settling back in his seat. "It caused a huge scandal. Stanford White was a successful society architect. He was shot in the head at point-blank range.""By whom?""The jealous husband of a young lady who claimed that White had seduced her when she was barely sixteen. She was not his only conquest, it transpired. Stanford White had a rather lurid private life. The press had a field day uncovering it.""What happened to the killer?" she wondered."He's in a mental institution in Fishkill. The first trial collapsed so they had a second one earlier this year. Harry Thaw--that was his name--was declared insane so he avoided the death penalty. Was there nothing about it in the English newspapers?""Nothing that I saw.""I'm surprised. It dominated the front pages over here. I would have thought that some of your reporters would latch onto the English connection.""English connection?""Yes, Genevieve," he said with a smile. "Incredible as it may seem, Harry Thaw had an aristocratic brother-in-law. No less a person than the Earl of Yarmouth.""Goodness!" she exclaimed. "An <i>earl</i>?""Don't be fooled by that title. In spite of his blue blood, he was nothing but an unemployed New York actor when he met Thaw's sister. The story goes that the Earl of Yarmouth was arrested for debt on the morning of his own wedding. They had to pay off his creditors for him."Dillman was an excellent guide, patient, knowledgeable, and keen to show her the sights. Genevieve was very grateful. Though she had visited New York City a number of times, she had never had the chance to take a proper look at Manhattan. Working for the Cunard Line was a pleasurable duty but it limited her free time. No sooner did she and Dillman dock in one ship than they were being assigned to another for an eastbound crossing. It suddenly struck Genevieve that her friendship with George Porter Dillman had developed, for the most part, on the treacherous waters of the Atlantic. It was a welcome change to spend more time with him on solid ground."Heavens!" said Genevieve as another dwelling caught her eye. "That's not a house at all. It's a veritable palace. An imitation French chï¿½teau."Dillman grinned. "Wait until you see the Vanderbilt mansions.""Why?""They're even more grandiose. There are three of them on Fifth Avenue. My favorite is the one on the corner of Fifty-second Street. It cost every bit of three million dollars.""I know the Vanderbilts like to splash their money around.""Ostentation is all part of the game," he said disapprovingly. "The house was built by William Kissam Vanderbilt at the behest of his loving wife, Alva. Apparently, it's a cross between the Chï¿½teau de Blois and a Renaissance mansion at Bourges. They also own a summer resort in Newport, Rhode Island. The Marble House is even more sumptuous than their residence here."Genevieve was impressed. "You seem to know a lot about them, George.""I was once a dinner guest of the Vanderbilts.""Were you?""Not that they would remember me," he admitted, "and it was not to the Marble House that I was bidden. It was to the other Vanderbilt mansion in Newport. An Italian palazzo of alabaster and gilt. It was built by Cornelius the second for his wife, Alice. They called it the Breakers. You'll get some idea of its size when I tell you that it needed almost fifty servants to run it.""How do you know?""Because I was there on that bizarre night when the Vanderbilt ballroom was filled with the uniforms of a historic British regiment. Take my word for it," he said, his eyes sparkling nostalgically. "I was wearing one of those uniforms."She was astonished. "You?""Along with all the other actors who were hired for the night. Cornelius the second had delusions that he was the Prince of Wales. His dear wife humored him by mounting this elaborate charade. It was very realistic. The attention to detail was remarkable." Dillman chuckled. "I bet you didn't know that I once served in the British army, did you?""No, George.""It was my first job as an actor. It gave me a taste for it.""You say that Mr. Vanderbilt had delusions?""His mind was quietly crumbling, poor fellow.""Think of the expense involved," she said, shaking her head in wonder. "His wife must have loved him to go to all that trouble on his behalf.""She was devoted to him, Genevieve. And there are far worse people he could have imagined himself to be than the present King Edward. Anyway," he went on with a fond smile, "that was the social highlight of my life. I had dinner with the Vanderbilts in a splendid red uniform.""Where did all their money come from?""That's the interesting thing.""Why?""The original Cornelius Vanderbilt started out as the captain of a ferry between New York and New Brunswick. From that humble beginning, he built up a fleet of freighters, then developed a transatlantic steamship line." Dillman gave a shrug. "After that, he moved into railways and made an even bigger fortune. Transport, Genevieve," he noted, wagging a finger. "That's where the Vanderbilt millions came from, and I think there's a lesson in it for us.""Us?""Of course," he replied with mock seriousness. "We're in the transport business as well, remember. We may be minor employees of the Cunard Line at the moment but, if we follow Vanderbilt's example, we'll end up ruling the oceans of the world."Genevieve laughed. "If only it were that easy!""What would you do with all your money?""I wouldn't waste it on a palatial mansion, I know that.""So how <i>would</i> you spend it, Genevieve?"She became pensive. "I'd travel the globe," she said at length."I was hoping you'd say that," he confessed, taking his cue,"because it brings me to the reason I wanted to show you something of New York today. I was seizing the opportunity while it still exists. If you agree to my suggestion, you won't be seeing this city again for quite some time.""Why not?""You'll be far, far away from here.""Will I?"He gave a nod. "How would you like to have a rest from crossing the Atlantic?""A holiday?""A working holiday, Genevieve. Aboard the Minnesota."She frowned slightly. "That's not a Cunard vessel, is it?""No, it belongs to the Great Northern Steamship Company.""I've never heard of them.""That's not surprising," he conceded. "They're a very small company. I just happen to have a friend who works for them and he's asked me to do him a favor.""What sort of favor?""The <i>Minnesota</i> has problems. I won't bore you with the details now. Suffice it to say that the ship needs some eagle-eyed detectives on its next voyage. I agreed to help.""But you have commitments to the Cunard Line.""I've spoken to them about that," he said, flicking a speck of dust from his sleeve.

The case study at its core is the demise of the Grenada Revolution (1979&#x2013;1983), and the repercussions of its collapse. In the Anglophone Caribbean, the Grenada Revolution represented both the possibility of a break from colonial and neocolonial oppression, and hope for egalitarian change and social and political justice. The Revolution's collapse in 1983 was devastating to a revolutionary generation. In hindsight, its demise signaled the end of an era of revolutionary socialist possibility. <i>Omens of Adversity</i> is not a history of the Revolution or its fallout. Instead, by examining related texts and phenomena, David Scott engages with broader, enduring issues of political action and tragedy, generations and memory, liberalism and transitional justice, and the possibility of forgiveness. Ultimately, Scott argues that the palpable sense of the neoliberal present as time stalled, without hope for emancipatory futures, has had far-reaching effects on how we think about the nature of political action and justice.</p><p><p>David Scott is Professor of Anthropology at Columbia University. He is the author of <i>Conscripts of Modernity: The Tragedy of Colonial Enlightenment</i> and the editor of <i>Small Axe: A Caribbean Journal of Criticism</i>, both also published by Duke University Press.</p>"The strength of <i>Omens of Adversity</i> lies in its ability to productively and persuasively move across interpretive practices, weaving together a diverse array of sources.... The work has deep implications for thinking about imaginations of the future" -- Stephen McIssac, <i>TOPIA</i><br><br>"Scholars struggling with similar questions and concepts will find here food for thought." -- Mark Thurner, <i>American Historical Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Omens of Adversity</i> is a grim, sobering, and tragic book that should be required for all graduate and advanced undergraduate courses in postcolonial theory, Caribbean history, cultural anthropology, and others dealing with the &#x201c;end of history&#x201d; or political transition theory. Scholars with those interests should consider it a must read. It is not only a cautionary tale to constantly take stock of the past lest we live in a recurring catastrophic present but also one of the most intellectually gratifying and adventurous books of recent years.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Suzanne Simon, <i>American Ethnologist</i><br><br>&#x201c;This conceptually very dense book is surely pioneering in the way that it redefines temporality and political action and gives a language and method to study past and/or failed revolutionary actions.&#x201d; -- Charlotte Loris-Rodinoff, <i>Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute</i><br><br>"<i>Omens of Adversity</i> will be of interest to students and scholars of Caribbean and postcolonial studies, political theory, Marxism and Revolution, Trauma and Memory Studies." -- Shalini Puri, <i>New West Indian Guide</i> Published On: 2016-06-01<br><br>"<i>Omens of Adversity</i> is a thought-provoking and thoroughly inspiring book. Particularly illuminating is the notion of the contemporary neoliberal predicament as a stagnant, stranded present, devoid of promises of a better future." -- Carl Rommel, <i>Social Anthropology</i> Published On: 2016-08-09<br><br>"In many ways, <i>Omens of Adversity</i> is a continuation and deepening of a line of thought that social and cultural theorist David Scott has been developing for years. . . . Scott&#x2019;s larger project is marked by a progressively more strident analysis, a darkening view of what he sees as our increasingly strangulated set of political possibilities. As such, <i>Omens </i>demands serious engagement by social and political theorists." -- Robert Nichols, <i>Political Theory</i> Published On: 2017-06-01<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Omens of Adversity</i> brings to the fore the political work that silences perform in post-revolutionary societies and provides conceptually potent models for anthropologists, historians, political scientists, and others interested in probing such questions further.&#x201d; -- Maarit Forde, <i>PoLAR</i> Published On: 2017-01-12</p><h2>The Ancient One</h2><p>When Kate travels to Blade, Oregon, to spend a quiet vacation with her Aunt Melanie, she has no idea of the adventures that lie ahead. Blade, Oregon is home of the magical Lost Crater, in which a grove of giant readwood trees has remained untouched for thousands of years. Now the ancient grove has become the center of a major dispute between those who wish to save this rare sanctuary and the local loggers who see Lost Crater as their last hope to rejuvenate their dying mill town. Caught up in the struggle, Kate feels compelled to learn more and decides to follow a trail into the crater, which, as legend has it, was made by the ancient Halami people believed to have once lived in the region. But for Kate, what starts out as a day's discovery soon turns intor a life's journey. With the help of an ancient walking stick, Kate is thrust back in time five hundred years. Quickly befriended by a young Halami girl, Laioni, Kate learns that not much as changed in five centuries as she is caught in the middle of a battle for the same wilderness. Confronted by a myrid of strange and frightening creatures, including the trickster Kandeldandel and the evil Gashra, who is bend on destroying everything he cannot control, Kate must complete her quest and return to her own time. But to do so, she must not only discover the truth behind her own beliefs, but also unravel an ancient and wondrous riddle bearing the knowledge of life's intricate and fragile balance.<br></p><p>For me, writing is exploring. Whether it's the surprising connections among people, the wondrous patterns of nature, or the mysterious wellsprings of the spirit--the universe beckons. I love to explore it, whether by foot or by pen. <p>Writing is both the most joyous--and most agonizing--labor I know. And it is by far the best way to travel--in our world or any other. Ever since my youth on a ranch in Colorado, I've felt passionate about nature--and about writing. I wrote and published my own magazine as a kid, called the Idiot's Odyssey, which sold about five copies an issue (including the ones my parents bought). I kept writing during my college years at Princeton, and during my years at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. During that time at Oxford, I composed stories and poems while hiking in the Scottish highlands, while sitting beneath the boughs of an English oak I named Merlin's tree, while backpacking through Asia, Africa, and the Arctic; and while participating in a traditional roof thatching in Japan. Even during my years managing a fast-growing business in New York City, I often rose before dawn to write. </p><p>Finally, I followed my dream to write full time. In 1990, I moved back to Colorado and started writing in the attic of my home, with the help of my wife and our five young children. </p><p>I am currently writing a five-book epic about the youth of Merlin. This epic gives me a chance to add a new dimension to the rich lore about this enduring figure. Why am I spending almost a decade writing about Merlin? Because he is much, much more than a great wizard. His story is, in truth, a metaphor--for the idea that all of us, no matter how weak or confused, have a magical person down inside--waiting to be discovered.

Following a life-changing decision to leave a successful business career to write full-time in 1990, Barron has written seventeen books, but is happiest when on the mountain trails with his wife, Currie, and their five children.<p> </p></p><h2>Beyond Walden: The Hidden History of America&#39;s Kettle Lakes and Ponds</h2><p><p><b>The geology, ecology, and cultural history of kettle lakes from Maine to Montana. </b><br><b></b><br><b></b>Lakes are a beloved part of the American landscape, and kettles are the most common type, spanning the northern part of the country from New England to the High Plains.

Between 1923 and 1938, the Singapore naval base had been upgraded with some of the largest coast guns ever installed. The guns&#x2019; design and incorrect siting have since been blamed for the humiliating debacle.<br><br>The Fatal Fortress traces the history of Singapore&#x2019;s fortifications and guns from the city&#x2019;s foundation in 1819 to the demise of coast artillery in the British Army in 1953. It also follows the development of artillery through the Victorian era of muzzleloading guns to the introduction of the large breech-loading guns of the twentieth century. The author argues that it was not the siting of the guns that brought about the fall of Singapore, but an overall failure in command and control and a lack of suitable ammunition.<br><br>The book is illustrated with a large number of photographs, drawings and plans, and contains a gazetteer describing all the batteries and forts, both existing and demolished.

Sean and Yanaba made no move to leave the nursery, unable to leave the sight of their offspring, safely delivered just a few hours earlier. The babies looked up at their parents, their dark pewter eyes as brightly focused as those of any bird. Each already wore a soft crown of deep brown downy hair, but Yana would have been hard pressed to decide whose nose or cheeks they had. Everything was still rounded and squashy, unformed and utterly adorable.<br><br>Even their contented gurgles sounded for all the world like the chortle of a small and active brook swirling among stones.<br><br>"Listen to them," Yana said fondly. "They sound as if they're laughing." Then, "I thought it took longer than that for babies to do things like laugh."<br><br>Sean shrugged. "Babies who are always and entirely human perhaps. But a selkie's development is a bit different. Faster in some ways. I don't recall when exactly I developed what, but I do recall being aware of my surroundings almost at once. But as to the details, well, too bad my parents aren't still around to advise us."<br><br>But Yana, lost in wonder at the perfection of her children, answered him only with a dreamy glance. "It's almost too much joy for one person to bear," she murmured, feeling tears come to her eyes.<br>Sean took her in his arms. "Then let's share it. I smell food, and you're still feeding two--one at a time." He gave her a hug and a cuddle and, one arm draped on her shoulders, propelled her gently toward the door of the cube they had hastily attached to one side of the cabin to serve as a nursery. It was spare and spartan except for the furred cots, for it was the custom in Kilcoole to refrain from giving expecting parents items for their unborn children. A superstition really, but since Yana, before conceiving, had thought herself well past childbearing age, it seemed wise to encourage every sort of good luck.<br><br>As Sean opened the door, Nanook, his black-and-white track cat, and Coaxtl, his niece Aoifa's snow leopard, slid into the nursery. Nanook took a place under the boy's cot, while Coaxtl, after one long look at her charge, flopped beside the girl's.<br><br>"The sentries are on the job," Sean said, and continued to push his wife to the door.<br><br>"I just never thought I'd have children," Yana said, looking back over her shoulder at her twins even as Sean closed the door behind her. He left it slightly ajar so they could hear the babies if they cried out or if one of the cats needed to go out or get their attention.<br><br>No smells had been able to penetrate the cube from the main part of the house, Yana's old one-room cabin. Now, however, delicious odors of pepper and snow onions, roasting fish and unidentifiable savory spices, wafted from the stove. Over it stood the substantial and comforting bulk of Clodagh, the village's shanachie, singer of songs, bearer of culture, rememberer of history, settler of disputes, healer of wounds, and dispenser of medicines. She had also served as Yana's midwife.<br><br>"It's about time," Clodagh said, closing the lid of the pot she had been seasoning. "I thought you'd never think of yourselves. Now, sit and eat. And Yana, use that longie thing," as she pointed a ladle at a chaise longue that had recently made its appearance in their home. There was no proscription against giving an expectant mother a gift for herself. The chaise, which took up a good half of the wall next to the woodstove, had seemed too large and in the way before, but now Yana found it inviting. "Get your feet up and relax. As much as you can, that is," she added in an affectionately derisive tone.<br><br>Major Yanaba Maddock-Shongili was quite willing to assume the seat and stretch her legs. Her overtaxed muscles carried her that far mostly because of Sean's support. He rearranged her feet a trifle and sat on the end, folding his arms over his chest and giving a sigh.<br><br>"Don't you dare look at your desk," Yana said sternly.<br><br>"Even from here I can see the pile of orange flimsies, and they mean urgent."<br><br>"Nothing is so urgent as feeding the pair of you up," Clodagh said staunchly, "and there really isn't anything that damned pressing that someone else can't handle or defer--preferably until next year."<br><br>"But those hydroelectric engineers were supposed to touch down today . . . and you know how eagerly Sister Igneous Rock is awaiting them." Sean referred to the planet's geological expert and its self-proclaimed acolyte. The woman and her fellow would-be Petaybean cult followers had surprised Petaybee's longer-term residents by turning out to be quite useful once they discovered they could be of more service to Petaybee practicing their hard-science specialties instead of their misguided attempts at theology.<br><br>"Iggierock has 'em and she's dealing with them." Clodagh gave a deep chuckle. "She's near as good as I am . . . at some things. But this stew will give you much-needed energy. And we've more urgent matters to consider, such as the babies' naming song and the latchkay. I'm thinking that tomorrow will be none too soon, if Yana can make it back to the lodge and the communion cave to properly introduce your young by name to their people and their world."<br><br>"She can and she will, if I must carry her," Sean said fondly.<br><br>"I can handle it," Yana said. Fortunately, those aching muscles of hers were well toned and trained from her years in the Company Corps. "It's the babies we'll need to be carrying."<br><br>"Good," Clodagh said. "All of Kilcoole has been waiting for these young ones, but there's a time and place for their gawking and well-wishing and filling your house up with doodads for the babbies. The sooner the better, though. Have you thought of what you'll call them at all?"<br><br>She dished up three huge bowls of her concoction, and after serving the new parents, she pulled up one of the new spare chairs to the new huge kitchen table they'd been given by friends who evidently thought they were going to have dozens of children instead of just two. Clodagh passed rolls just out of the oven, and steaming through the white napkin she had covered them with.<br><br>Yana chewed quickly but deliberately, thinking hard. "Of course we've thought about it, but now that they're here, no name seems special enough. Among my mother's ancestors, you know, babies weren't named right away. High infant mortality rate was one reason, but also, her people believed a child didn't get its soul until the first time it laughed."<br><br>She and Sean looked at each other over their full spoons and smiled. "Which they've already done, and them only a few hours old," Sean said. "I can tell they're going to be quick, but then, it's well-known that all of the children born to my side of the family are very precocious."<br><br>Yana made a face at him. "Oh, in my family too, but our babies are also taught to be modest."<br><br>"You two are too giddy by half!" Clodagh mock-scolded, shaking her spoon at them. "Naming is a serious business. It should fit the baby's bloodlines--perhaps we could have names from your mother's people, Yana. There'd be a bit of novelty. It should also tell the world what the child is all about."<br><br>"This world knows what the children are about," Yana said. "It's responsible for their selkie nature, after all--well, it and their father," she added with a roll of her dark eyes at her husband. "And how advisable it is to tell the rest of the universe about that is debatable."<br><br>"No debate about it," Sean said in a tone that brooked no argument. "The universe at large does not need to know that our children mutate into seals when they submerge themselves in water any more than it needs to know that the kids inherited that trait from me."<br><br>"Well, the names don't need to come right out and say, 'I'm a selkie,' " Clodagh said. "But they should, for instance, indicate that these children have an affinity for water."<br><br>"Born for Water," Yana said with a swallow of soup.<br><br>"What?"<br><br>She gestured with a piece of roll. "I'm just thinking perhaps we should call them after the Hero Twins my mother's ancestors revered, Born for Water and Monster Slayer. Except at the moment they both seem to be Born for Water and it isn't yet clear who would be Monster Slayer."<br><br>"My money is on the wee lassie," Sean said. "She's got something of the look of you in the glint in her eyes and the set of her chin."<br><br>"She's barely got a chin," Yana said, shaking her head. "No, I think we'll have to go with the Irish side of my family this time. Here in Kilcoole where you're all Irish and Inuit, they'll blend in better with the other children that way anyway. Besides, among the Dine--my mother's people--girls all have war names like mine, and war is the last thing I want my daughter named for. Water's a bit difficult too. The sacred land of Mother's people had very little rain, or standing water either, and so they were extremely short even on fish, not to mention seals and selkies."<br><br>She stopped with her spoon halfway to her mouth. "I just had a thought. Will the babies be transforming every time they get into water? Any water? If so, I'm going to have a fine old time trying to bathe them and it won't be easy keeping their nature a family secret."<br><br>"I used to have the same problem," Sean grinned. "Until I taught myself not to fur up the moment a drop touched me. But I had no da to show me the way, and they do. Meanwhile, if you need help with the family secret, well, we've plenty of family here who know all about it. They'll help. And the four-foots will watch to make sure no outsiders come close enough to learn more than they should."<br><br>"You say that, Sean," Clodagh said, speaking quietly into her soup bowl, "but there are outsiders who've seen you change, and one of them may take it upon himself to wonder if the twins inherited the ability and need studying." She looked up, her moss green eyes fathomless and deep as one of Petaybee's many artesian springs, seeming troubled. She hated bringing up such worries on what should be a flawlessly happy day. "You know how much scrutiny this planet is under."<br><br>"Well, how the hell could they possibly interfere with my family peculiarity when Yana and I have the final say as governors of this planet?" Sean asked.<br><br>Clodagh shrugged.<br><br>"As long as the four-foots are their guards, no one will get near them," Yana said with far more conviction than she felt. "And Nanook and Coaxtl will keep them from being seen, won't they?" A nervous tic started in her cheek. She rubbed it. "Will the cats follow them into the water?"<br><br>"Yes," Sean said positively. "If the little ones elude them long enough to get near water, Nanook and Coaxtl would follow them into the mouth of a volcano if necessary. The cats do converse. We just have to make it plain to them how dangerous it would be for the kids to be caught half in, half out. Like I was."<br><br>"We'll hope they don't take arrows in their anatomy to induce such a condition," Yana said, referring to what was nearly a mortal wound for him. "And I thought leading training troops on landing parties for the Company Corps was a heavy responsibility!" She shook her head as if to clear it. "We're borrowing trouble. It's not as if shape-changing is a viable occupation."<br><br>"Oh, selkies would be real useful on water worlds," Sean argued.<br><br>"Yana's right, Sean. There's trouble enough right here and now without borrowing any," Clodagh said in a cajoling tone. "Don't fall into that water until the ice breaks up. For now your biggest problem is to decide what these babes of yours are to be called. I will think on it, remember the stories of our peoples, see if there's some appropriate names there. You and Yana should sleep while you have the chance. The cats can't take care of all the needs those babes will have."<br>The drumming began shortly after sunrise. Inside the nursery cube, the twins opened their eyes to the brightness pouring in through the piece of sheeting that covered the cube's single small window. The babies whimpered and wiggled.<br><br>Nanook's ears were the first part of him to wake up. They pricked to attention. Coaxtl's tail lashed restlessly before the snow leopard stretched a sleepy paw. The kits had awakened. Both cats stretched and rose, poking their noses over the sides of the cots.<br><br>"Rrrow," Nanook told his friend. "I'd cry too if I smelled like that. Where are those humans when you need them?"<br><br>"These cubs leak," Coaxtl agreed. "And they've got these things tied around their haunches to hold the leakage in. One wonders how humans come up with such ideas. This arrangement keeps the nest clean but the cubs dirty."<br><br>"Sean would not want his kits to be dirty," Nanook said.<br><br>"Can one pull these haunch harnesses off so one can clean them?" Coaxtl inquired.<br><br>"Yes, they are meant to be removable. But take care with fang and claw. We want to remove the harnesses only, not the kits' pelts. Humans, lacking proper coats, have very sensitive hides."<br><br>Nanook's nose touched the kit's leg as he grasped a pinch of cloth in his teeth. The kit stopped whimpering. He looked at it anxiously lest it was merely saving its breath for a good howl, but it was staring at him, wide-eyed and curious. Disconcerting, these human younglings, born with their eyes all open and gawking.<br><br>"Hee," the kit said aloud, quite distinctly giggling.<br><br>"Hee," the female kit echoed, pumping a plump fist in the air.<br><br>Tickles, one of them--the female?--said.<br><br>Ma? the other inquired.<br><br>No, child, I am Nanook, your keeper. Your mother sleeps. And this one is Coaxtl, also your keeper.<br>'Nook. Nanook realized suddenly that the boy's more advanced utterances were mental and that it understood as well as transmitted thoughts.<br><br>Co'. The female kit was also transmitting thoughts.<br><br>Co-ax-tl, the snow leopard said with a dignified fluff of her tufted cheeks. You may as well get it right to begin with, youngling.<br><br>Co'.<br><br>Nanook sat back on his haunches. The harness was too close to the tender skin. "Don't growl, leopard. They will learn. When I was their age, my mother had to lick me to teach me to do what they've already done in their harnesses."<br><br>Coaxtl sat back too. "This harness removal is for those with thumbs.

Family recollections of life a century ago summon up an aura of devotion to tsar and church. The unjust, benevolent, complicated, and ultimately doomed relationship between master and peasants--leading to growing unrest, then to civil war--is subtly captured.<br><br>Diary entries record the social breakdown step by step: grievances going unresolved, the government foundering, the status quo of rural life overcome by revolutionary fervor. Soon we see the estate brutally collectivized, the church torn apart brick by brick, the manor house burned to the ground. Some of the family are killed in the fighting; others escape into exile; one writes to his kin for the last time from the Gulag.<br><br>The Soviet era is experienced as a time of privation, suffering, and lost illusions. The Nazi occupation inspires valorous resistance, but at great cost. Eventually all that remains of Sergiyevskoye is an impoverished collective.<br><br>Without idealizing the tsarist past or wholly damning the regime that followed, Schmemann searches for a lost heritage as he shows how Communism thwarted aspiration and initiative. Above all, however, his book provides for us a deeply felt evocation of the long-ago life of a corner of Russia that is even now movingly beautiful despite the ravages of history and time.</p><p>Russia is a land of far-flung villages, even though most of its history has been made in the cities. In this affecting narrative, <i>New York Times</i> correspondent Serge Schmemann returns to his ancestral village of Koltsovo, 90 miles south of Moscow, to plumb the histories of both his forebears and the country. Drawing on a range of archival material, Schmemann offers a narrative as packed with names, incidents, and memories as any Tolstoy novel. His search for roots yields a compassionate portrait of a nation in difficult times that is full of details about daily life.Serge Schmemann has served as the New York Times bureau chief in Moscow, Bonn, and now Jerusalem. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1990 for his reporting on the reunification of Germany. Born in France to a family of Russian ï¿½migrï¿½s, he came to the United States in 1951 and was raised here. He and his wife have three children.</p><h2>The Second Coming</h2><p><b>The Son of God is back on Earth and starring on American Pop Star.</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God takes a look at the Earth around the time of the Renaissance and everything looks pretty good - so he takes a holiday.

She explains the blend of African, Cajun, Creole, and other influences such as gumbo and jambalaya behind their enticing flavors, describing the meals of the slave quarters and elegant plantation houses and, along the way, passing on family anecdotes and kitchen secrets handed down from generation to generation.<br><br>Some recipes, such as cornmeal griddlecakes, pigs&#x2019; feet, smothered okra and tomatoes, or brown suga&#x2019; pound cake, are old-fashioned country favorites. Others, such as sautï¿½ed scallops, vegetables seasoned with smoked turkey, and roast pheasant with wild rice stuffin&#x2019;, are well suited to today&#x2019;s more sophisticated palates.

Why trust them to anything but a memory box that has been carefully and lovingly crafted by hand? <p>If you've ever filled a cigar box with marbles or a shoe box with family photos, you will want to pick up Making Memory Boxes. This quirky and beautiful book teaches collectors and crafters how to build their own personal boxes to store favored keepsakes free of intimidation and ready to be transported from the workshop table to the kitchen table. Make thirteen precious boxes for holding cherished postcards, letters, jewelry, photos, and more. Making Memory Boxes features tips and tricks to ensure accurate measuring, cutting, and gluing.</p></p><p>Barbara Mauriello is a hand bookbinder and conservator, and teaches bookbinding and boxmaking at the International Center of Photography, The Center for Book Arts, and Penland School of Crafts.It is a fact of life that most of us practice the art of pack ratting, hoarding and saving ticket stubs, love letters, postcards, and other memorabilia. Now, artist-curator Mauriello^B guides us in collecting treasures in one place by crafting aesthetically pleasing containers, or memory boxes. Each of the 13 boxes is targeted to contain one type of collectible--buttons, fabric scraps, or a child's treasures, for instance. Tips abound, as does information about getting started, from critical-to-own materials and tools to the appropriate ways to paste paper or cloth to a board. (The trick, by the way, is to apply adhesive to the paper, not to the surface. Cloth, on the other hand, doesn't matter.) The project boxes, colorful and well designed, feature detailed illustrated instructions and occasional suggestions for a different look. A practical craft that just might lead to a new kind of collecting habit. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Precipitated by the assassination of the Austro- Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife in the streets of Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, World War I demolished the order established by the Concert of Vienna, an order that had maintained the peace in Europe for almost a century. The ensuing carnage laid the foundation for World War II and the Cold War that followed.<br><p>World War I also left in its catastrophic wake three transformational legacies that remain largely unnoticed today. These legacies have provoked and will continue to provoke massive change to the international order. But containing, mitigating, and preventing these disruptions from exploding into major crises will prove no less difficult a challenge than did restraining the forces that ignited the chaos and violence of the last century.<br></p><p>These legacies would make Osama bin Laden into a modern day version of Gavrilo Princip, the Archduke's assassin, and turn September 11, 2001 into an event like that one on June 28, 1914, in many different and frightening ways. Instead of using a Beretta 9 mm pistol, bin Laden crashed three airliners into New York's Twin Towers and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., starting a global war on terror.<br></p>Unfortunately, America's current strategic mindset to deal with the twenty-first century remains firmly anchored in the previous century. That mindset must change if aspirations for peace and prosperity are to be met with decisive and effective actions. Ullman offers provocative and challenging arguments to conventional wisdom--that we fail to understand the challenges and dangers and lack a mindset to cope with these twenty-first-century realities. He argues that while the dangers are not as destructive as a world war, unless they are addressed, at best the standard of living and expectations of Americans will decline, and at worst, the world will become more violent, unpredictable, and chaotic.</p><p>Harlan K. Ullman is a strategic thinker and innovator whose career spans the worlds of business and government. Chairman of several companies and an advisor to the heads of major corporations and governments, he was the principal author of &#34;Shock and Awe.&#34; A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, he served in combat in assignments in Vietnam. He holds an MA, MALD, and PhD from The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and lives in Washington, D.C."...this is a most useful treatise of contemporary threats (it is current up to late 2014) and the so far unsuccessful efforts to stem the assaults of the four horsemen. While centered on US policy shortfalls, the book should nevertheless be read by aspiring strategists, diplomats and military thinkers; not necessarily to agree with Ullman, but to assess where the archduke's assassination has taken us in the past century and how we can visualize and articulate a more stable and peaceful future." <b>--Australian Naval Institute</b><p><br><br>"<i>A Handful of Bullets</i> is sweeping and allows the author to comment on the major issues of our time. His critique is often withering and his recommendations call for fundamental change that will be difficult to implement. But if Ullman is right about the cumulative impact of his 'Four New Horsemen of the Apocalypse' ([sic] failing government; economic despair; religious extremism; and environmental catastrophe), such fundamental reforms may be needed."<b><i>--PRISM</i></b><br><br></p>"...this book represents a serious and mostly successful attempt to diagnose the causes of contemporary crises, give a clear eyed view of what potential futures exist, and give some thoughtful and thought-provoking recommendations as to how to best achieve those futures that are the most favorable to the United States and its people, and to the people of the world at large."<b>--Naval Historical Foundation</b><p><br><br>"There is not enough space in a short review adequately to summarize Ullman's comprehensive survey of the Princips and archdukes of our age, nor his extensive and frequently controversial list of remedies and reforms. But agree or disagree, every citizen who is serious about the nation's global challenges should weigh the situation and strategy assessments of this iconoclastic and readable thinker."<b><i>--HuffPost Books</i></b><br><br>"Ullman's book is a worthwhile read, and national security experts should consider his conceptual arguments." --<i><b>Naval War College</b></i><br><br>"Although US-centric, and understandably so, this book is refreshing in the honesty with which it critiques the US system. It stares with confidence in the mirror and recognises the bad as well as the good. At times, this work presents a bleak picture but there is plenty of sound reasoning to back it up, and solutions are offered too. It is the sort of book that you will think about, and talk about, long after you have turned the final page, and I will definitely be keeping an eye out for those new four horsemen."<b><i>--Australian Defence Force Journal</i></b><br><br>"...Ullman makes a powerful and timely plea for a reinvigoration of strategic thinking within the U.S. defensive apparatus. He has specific and useful suggestions--the restructuring of U.S. Cyber Command, the intelligent use of reserve status for ships and units to provide the flexible defensive capacity, a special U.S. ambassador to NATO to reinvigorate that alliance, and discarding the U.S. Army War College and inculcating a culture of 'brain-based' solutions. This idea is worthy of consideration."<b><i>--Military Review</i></b><br><br>"If ever there was a bad time to have lost the art of strategy, this is it. Harlan Ullman explains graphically why the West needs statesmen, not politicians. Read this book; it's compelling and chilling, in equal measure."--<b>General the Lord Richards of Hertsmonceaus,late Chief of Defence Staff United Kingdom</b><br><br>"Harlan Ullman is both a highly experienced observer and a great practitioner of international politics, having served as an advisor to heads of state and heads of industry. This book is a classic and is must reading for both his analysis and recommendations.

This is the first complete biography of Cadwallader Colden (1688-1776), one of the most accomplished intellectual and political figures in the American colonies before the Revolution. As the longest-serving Lieutenant Governor of New York he was intimately involved in the tumultuous political life of the times. History of the Five Indian Nations (1727) was the first English history of the Iroquois and a popular book both in the colonies and in Europe. Colden was also a trained physician. Though he never practiced, he significantly improved the public health of the colony. Furthermore, he was an internationally recognized botanist, the author of the first scientific paper published in the colonies, and an accomplished cartographer who published the first map in the colony of New York. A prolific letter writer, Colden corresponded with many of the major intellectuals of his day, including Benjamin Franklin and Samuel Johnson. In addition, he wrote extensively on a wide range of topics, including philosophy, history, the natural sciences, and mathematics. Why has this distinguished individual fallen into obscurity? As an ardent royalist he was the most vilified of the colonial leaders and was even burned in effigy.

This is engaged sociology at its most stimulating."<br> ---Todd Gitlin<br> <br> ". . . unflinchingly portrays the reemergence of the sweatshop in our dog-eat-dog economy."<br> ---<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br> Just as Barbara Ehrenreich's <i>Nickel and Dimed</i> uncovered the plight of the working poor in America, Robert J. S. Ross's <i>Slaves to Fashion</i> exposes the dark side of the apparel industry and its exploited workers at home and abroad. It's both a lesson in American business history and a warning about one of the most important issues facing the global capital economy-the reappearance of the sweatshop.<br> <br> Vividly detailing the decline and tragic rebirth of sweatshop conditions in the American apparel industry of the twentieth century, Ross explains the new sweatshops as a product of unregulated global capitalism and associated deregulation, union erosion, and exploitation of undocumented workers. Using historical material and economic and social data, the author shows that after a brief thirty-five years of fair practices, the U.S. apparel business has once again sunk to shameful abuse and exploitation.<br> <br> Refreshingly jargon-free but documented in depth, <i>Slaves to Fashion</i> is the only work to estimate the size of the sweatshop problem and to systematically show its impact on apparel workers' wages. It is also unique in its analysis of the budgets and personnel used in enforcing the Fair Labor Standards Act.<br> <br> Anyone who is concerned about this urgent social and economic topic and wants to go beyond the headlines should read this important and timely contribution to the rising debate on low-wage factory labor.</p> <p> </p><p> </p> <p>Robert J.S. Ross is Professor of Sociology, Clark University. He is an expert in the area of sweatshops and globalization. He is an activist academic who travels and lectures extensively and has published numerous related articles.</p> <br> <br><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Montage and the Metropolis: Architecture, Modernity, and the Representation of Space</h2><p>Montage has been hailed as one of the key structural principles of modernity, yet its importance to the history of modern thought about cities and their architecture has never been adequately explored. In this groundbreaking new work, Martino Stierli charts the history of montage in late 19th-century urban and architectural contexts, its application by the early 20th-century avant-gardes, and its eventual appropriation in the postmodern period. With chapters focusing on photomontage, the film theories of Sergei Eisenstein, Mies van der Rohe&#x2019;s spatial experiments, and Rem Koolhaas&#x2019;s use of literary montage in his seminal manifesto <i>Delirious New York</i> (1978), Stierli demonstrates the centrality of montage in modern explorations of space, and in conceiving and representing the contemporary city. Beautifully illustrated, this interdisciplinary book looks at architecture, photography, film, literature, and visual culture, featuring works by artists and architects including Mies, Koolhaas, Paul Citroen, George Grosz, Hannah Hï¿½ch, El Lissitzky, and Le Corbusier.</p><p>Beautifully illustrated with wide-ranging examples, this interdisciplinary book looks at montage from many angles, including architecture, art, photography, and film, establishing its centrality in modern explorations of space and the city.<b>Martino Stierli</b> is Philip Johnson Chief Curator of Architecture and Design at the Museum of Modern Art.</p><h2>Rock Climbing Santa Barbara &amp; Ventura (Regional Rock Climbing Series)</h2><p>Santa Barbara and Ventura counties have long been known as sublime tourist areas, but the rock climbing and bouldering along the California&#39;s south-central coast are just beginning to attract the attention they richly deserve.

He gave Karigan his horse, his cloak and his brooch - the symbol that he was one of the King&#39;s Green Riders - and, with them, his mission. To deliver a message to the King. He made her swear to do it ...even though the Shadow Man who killed him would be hot on her trail. That mission made her a Green Rider. Now, her first legendary mission is long complete.

These deaths are rarely true &#x201c;accidents,&#x201d; because most maritime incidents are caused by lack of preparedness. If you frequently participate in aquatic activities, have you stopped to consider the nature of the threat confronting you? What steps can you take to improve your chances of surviving in the water or on a survival craft? Is your knowledge of the basic principles sufficient to enable you to adapt, improvise, and survive? </p><p>Reading <i>Essentials of Sea Survival</i> prepares you to avoid disaster, even in the worst-case scenario. The book is a compelling, informative, and comprehensive guide to open-water survival. Drawing on historical anecdotes as well as published scientific research, it examines the nature of the many threats confronting the survivor at sea and outlines, in lay terms, the methods you can use to prevent or minimize the dangers. </p><p>Authors Frank Golden and Michael Tipton are internationally recognized experts in cold-water survival. In <i>Essentials of Sea Survival</i> they explain the scientific reasoning behind much of the conventional teaching on open-water survival, dispel many misconceptions about how and why people die at sea, and provide up-to-date information on sustained survival in cold water. The lessons they teach are drawn from classic maritime disasters and personal accounts of near-miraculous survival, as well as carefully controlled laboratory experiments.</p><p>The first half of the book deals predominantly with the physiological and behavioral responses to cold, immersion, and drowning. The second half addresses techniques for survival and rescue, either in the water or in a lifeboat. You'll find</p><p>- detailed explanations of hypothermia, cold shock, drowning, and near drowning;<br>- well-researched information on the physiological responses to short- and long-term immersion and exposure;<br>- a commonsense approach to life jacket, flotation device, and survival gear selection; and<br>- step-by-step explanations of how to safely abandon ship, board a life craft, dispense water and rations, divide duties, conserve energy and strength, and proceed with a successful rescue.</p><p><i>Essentials of Sea Survival</i> is a fascinating blend of historical anecdote, scientific fact, and practical application. Historical examples put the scientific content into real-life context, making it understandable and memorable. You'll also appreciate the easily accessible chapter summaries and recommendations, helpful glossary of terms, and list of references for those who want even more information on the subject.</p><p>No other book offers the scope and depth you'll find in <i>Essentials of Sea Survival</i> . Scientists and academic audiences will find the technical research of interest, and recreational water sport participants will enjoy the real-life scenarios as well as the practical advice on how to endure the elements at sea. Essentials of Sea Survival gives you a comprehensive and practical understanding of the dangers you face so that you can construct an informed survival strategy and maximize your chance of open-water survival should disaster strike.</p><p></p></p><p>"If you are going to be on the water, you need a survival strategy.

He is a genuinely revolutionary poet, neither simple-minded nor difficult, though his thought and imagery are complex. A deeply divided man, his poetry has a robust physicality as well as a jaunty and heroic intelligence-which is Marxist in its dedication but fueled in its audacity by both Freud and Surrealism. This new collection of his poetry includes two lengthy essays by the translators on his life and his art of poetry.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: HungarianJï¿½zsef is arguably the greatest Hungarian poet of this century, and this new collection of his writing is well worth having for the lengthy biographical and critical essays that proceed the verse. Bearing more than a passing resemblance to Kafka, Jï¿½zsefs life was short, and it bordered on the nightmarish. He was born in 1905 into poverty so extreme that to call his childhood Dickensian would be to glamorize it; he attempted suicide repeatedly (beginning before he was nine); and he finally succeeded in killing himself (under the most ghastly circumstances) when he was 32. In his brief lifetime, Jï¿½zsef was politically intrigued without being politically committed in any recognizable sense, and he managed to drift in and out of Marxism while remaining a deeply committed radical. His verse is a jagged, almost hysterically intense amalgam of nature imagery, cosmology, and bitter, yearning love poetry, with a surrealist edge that lends a bitter humorbut will move few to laughter. Almost all of his poetry was written in one 13-year period, and it bears the marks of such compression: it puts one in mind, in its overheated extravagance, of the power of extruded molten steel taking shape under the most extraordinary pressureat once destructive and yet fiercely creative, with a powerful erotic charge. But the translations do Jï¿½zsef a disservice, yoking themselves to his rhyme schemes with results that are plodding and unwittingly quaint. A useful collection for its extensiveness, but better translations by Edmund Morgan and John Bï¿½tki are available. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½ 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

Schwarz (Rose Kennedy: A Life of Faith, Family, and Tragedy, 1995) tries to take a more evenhanded approach to Duke's life story than last year's trashing by her cousin Pony Duke in Too Rich: The Family Secrets of Doris Duke. Coauthor Rybak worked for about two years as Duke's personal chef and was also partly responsible for the hiring of the infamous butler, the late Bernard Lafferty, who supervised--and perhaps helped to hasten- -Duke's death in 1993 at age 80. According to the authors, Duke's father, Buck, was the primary influence in her life, the man who taught Doris to ``trust no one'' and passed on his own obsessions: sex, money, and agriculture. As to sex, Doris's lovers were numerous and varied, from her first husband, the well-bred but financially strapped Jimmy Cromwell, to the jazz pianist Joey Castro. As for money and agriculture, Doris nurtured the Duke fortune from millions to billions and along the way became a botanical expert, specializing in orchids. She was also an accomplished jazz pianist with some recordings to her credit. Although Duke gets recognition for her accomplishments, including her expertise in Eastern art, this biography indulges heavily in speculation about family crimes, including several ``murders.'' Credibility shrinks from sloppy inconsistencies and offensive characterizations, such as the description of Irish immigrants as ``drinking, dancing and brawling.'' The book ends with long, unenlightening excerpts from civil and criminal investigations relating to Duke's death and her will, and peculiar paeans to an attorney representing some Duke employees. An attempt at a fair hearing for the headline heiress that is negated by trivia and hearsay. (8 pages b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Depending on your interpretation of glamorous, this book could be more appropriately titled <i>The Bizarre Life and Bizarre Death of Doris Duke</i>. Born in 1912 to an unhappy union between a tobacco baron and his coldhearted, mean-spirited wife, Duke lost her father in early childhood, leaving her an unimaginable fortune estimated at her recent death as being more than $3 billion. After her father's death, which her mother was apparently instrumental in causing, Duke gradually won her independence from her mother and embarked on a life of failed marriages, sleazy affairs, drug and alcohol dependency, sensationally bizarre acts (like adopting a 35-year-old woman), trying out new religions, and jet-setting between her three exclusive properties. Duke died in her late 70s, and her death, shrouded in mystery, has been the subject of much speculation and innuendo. This book, while rendering a concise, if extremely dark, portrayal of the lives of the very wealthy, leaves the reader with the feeling of witnessing a bad car accident, horrified and repulsed yet somehow transfixed. <i>Kathleen Hughes</i></p><h2>Walking in the Truth: A Companion Study for Lies Women Believe</h2><p>Satan is a liar.

Apologies, as it'll now be stuck in yours for the next couple of days, but Elizabeth Haynes' highly suspenseful and cleverly crafted psychological thriller will haunt you for much longer. In it we find our obsessive-compulsive heroine, Catherine Bailey, checking and rechecking her door locks six times, eschewing red clothing, shopping only on certain days--clearly something horrible has happened, and Haynes masterfully teases out the disturbing details, which involve a Jekyll and Hyde boyfriend. As the story unfolds, it provides subtle insight into why, despite red flags and bruises, someone would stay in an abusive relationship, and it makes you root for Catherine all the more to overcome the psychological fallout. If you're a fan of cinematic showdowns, you won't be disappointed. But the quietly powerful moments in Haynes' narrative resonate even more, as she illustrates that one of the bravest things someone can do is lock the door behind her, maybe five or six times, and step out into an uncertain world again. <i>--Erin Kodicek</i><p>When young, pretty Catherine Bailey meets Lee Brightman, she can't believeher luck.

Ping has grown to become a skilled Dragon Keeper, but her greatest challenge is yet to come. After rescuing the baby dragon, Kai, from the evil Emperor, she brings him to a safe haven near the border of the Empire. Now, as Kai grows into a restless young dragon, Ping faces a tough decision. She must find a way to take Kai to the ancient haven of the dragons. Following cryptic clues left by the wise dragon, Danzi, Ping and Kai set off on a long and dangerous journey filled with old friends and new enemies. But the biggest surprise awaits them at the end of their travels, when Ping quickly learns that the hardest part of being a Dragon Keeper may be realizing when it&#x2019;s time to let go.<br><br>With this story of tender friendships and heroic adventure, Carole Wilkinson brings her epic trilogy about dragons in ancient China to a thrilling and satisfying end.</p><p>Carole Wilkinson is the award-winning author of more than a dozen books for children, including<i>Dragon Keeper</i>and<i>Garden of the Purple Dragon</i>. Originally from Derby, England, Carole now lives in Melbourne, Australia, with her husband and daughter. You can learn more at www.carolewilkinson.com.au.Young Ping at last finds a haven for her beloved dragon hatchling Kai in this contrived but adequate conclusion to a trilogy that began with Dragon Keeper (2005). Guided by a cryptic map and a prophecy that the author, for some reason, reveals only in parts and after the events it describes have happened, Ping and Kai set out over vast stretches of drought-stricken land and into high ranges of mountains in hopes of reaching a place where other dragons still dwell, safe from rapacious hunters. Rehearsing previous episodes and running into previously met characters as they go, the two endure harrowing dangers and hardships - and Ping has to make a wrenching sacrifice - before their quest comes to an end. For all the tale&#39;s uneven pacing and quality, Ping&#39;s loyalty, intelligence and tenacity make her an admirable character, and dracophiles will enjoy watching the puppylike Kai at least begin (dragons are very long-lived) to come into his own.

They&#x2019;re given many names&#x2014;mala, rosary, misbahah, komboloi, prayer beads&#x2014;but no matter the culture or context, they&#x2019;re a tangible symbol of connection. Beads can tell a story, celebrate someone or something we love, or help us work through a difficulty. They can be made from a huge variety of materials, but it&#x2019;s not so much what beads you string but why and how you string them that is important. In <i>Mindful Beads</i>, Alice Peck reveals the meanings behind 20 different types of beads, from traditional Tibetan malas to healing crystals, and Greek worry beads to Christian rosaries. For each one, she strings her own bracelet, mala, rosary, or necklace, giving it a significance personal to her, and then explains how you can do so for your own beads, suggesting ways to meditate with and become connected to them. Some beads are handmade and step-by-step artworks are provided to explain how to make them, while a resources section offers advice on sourcing store-bought beads.</p><p><p>Discover the stories and meanings behind 20 types of beads, and learn how to instill your own beads with significance, protection, and promise as you string them.</p>Alice Peck is an author and editor living with her family in Brooklyn, New York.

Cultural historian Herbert Lottman finds a great way to explain dada: by focusing on its court photographer, Man Ray. <i>Man Ray's Montparnasse</i> brings you into the salons of Peggy Guggenheim and Gertrude Stein, and gives context to his dazzling photos: his naked mistress Kiki impersonating a violin; Duchamp impersonating a woman named Rrose Selavy (pronounced "c'est la vie"); Picasso as a toreador; and Proust on his deathbed, asleep at last, seemingly at peace and in some sort of reverie.<p> If one man's life could sum up the explosively creative international arts enclave Montparnasse in Paris between the wars, doubtless it would be Man Ray. Who else crossed paths with Hemingway, Mayakovski, Calder, James Joyce, T.S. Eliot, Atget, Satie, Cocteau, the battling bohemians Andrï¿½ Breton and Tristan Tzara, and Arno Breker, who wound up as Hitler's favorite sculptor? It was a tumultuously innovative time. The antiwar Swiss loathed the elitist French dadaists; dadaists quarreled with surrealists. Breton broke a writer's arm with his cane because he badmouthed Picasso, Duchamp, and Gide. When Malcolm Cowley punched out a reactionary restaurateur, it was a great career move--his fame spurred his nascent literary career. Apollinaire warned young dada friends against Cocteau ("Don't trust Cocteau! He's a cheat and a chameleon!"), because he was a darling of high society. Eluard said the surrealists would "shoot him down like a stinking animal."</p><p> What made Man Ray an instant insider was his skill with the camera and his refusal to join the culture wars. "My neutral position was invaluable to all," he said. "I became an official recorder of events and personalities." "He was like the kid on the block with the guitar invited to everyone's party," writes Lottman. "He lived a double life, dressing for dinner in society, then reassuming a bohemian posture for life among the writers and painters." </p><p> Lottman's book is delightful, a quick read that makes legendary names in the history of art come alive as wildly misbehaving young people. When Henry Miller would drunkenly harangue a cafï¿½, he earned a catcall: "Why don't you write a book?" Reading Lottman, you get a vivid sense of how the overlapping lives in that astounding time and place erupted in art. It's a privilege to be invited to such a historic party. <i>--Victoria Ellison</i></p>Herbert R. Lottman has published over a dozen books, including a history of Paris&#39;s Left Bank and biographies of Camus, Flaubert, Colette, and Jules Verne, and contributed to many magazines and newspapers.

Despite some difficulties, their style is generally direct and their contents interesting to modern readers. In these poems the anonymous poets speak as characters from story.

This selection includes dramatic dialogues and monologues exploring the acceptable limits of heroism. The old warrior, Llywarch Hen, mourns his sons&#39; death in battle and his lonely old age full of regrets. Heledd, the only major female character in the saga poetry, laments the loss of her family and her country to the invading English. A Selection of Early Welsh Saga Poems, the fifth volume of the Library of Medieval Welsh Literature Series, presents edited texts from the main manuscripts. The introduction offers a guide to interpretation, dating, and metrics, while a full glossary and explanatory notes make these poems readily accessible to the reader.

Reprint. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>Author and motivational speaker Kent M. Keith helps people find personal meaning and happiness in their lives and work. He earned his B.A. at Harvard and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford and at Waseda University in Tokyo. He holds a law degree as well as a doctorate in education.The Paradoxical Commandments took on a life of their own after Keith wrote them as a Harvard sophomore more than 30 years ago. They became almost a law unto themselves for doing good despite people and circumstances. They were used by religious leaders across the globe, including Mother Teresa, to illustrate truths found in the Christian Bible. Now Keith writes his third book on the Paradoxical Commandments, this time relating them to Christian faith and the Bible. Keith, a person of faith himself, knows that people search for meaningful lives, and he uses his Paradoxical Commandments to help provide such meaning. Each chapter lists the commandment, then draws on a teaching of Jesus or other figures in the Christian Bible to help explain it. He uses the biblical stories of the prodigal son, David, Moses, Job and the "good Samaritan," among others, to illustrate the commandments. Keith's presentation is simple and straightforward, his links between each commandment and the Bible easy to understand if a bit obvious. This is a pleasing introduction to the Paradoxical Commandments, as well as an easy-to-swallow introduction to the Christian Scriptures. Study guides for each chapter move into deeper discussion and reflection. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This book, hailed as a masterwork on its publication in France, takes up the epic narrative at the heart of this turbulent period: the life of Napoleon himself, the man who&#x2015;in Madame de Staï¿½l&#x2019;s words&#x2015;made the rest of &#x201c;the human race anonymous.&#x201d; Gueniffey follows Bonaparte from his obscure boyhood in Corsica, to his meteoric rise during the Italian and Egyptian campaigns of the Revolutionary wars, to his proclamation as Consul for Life in 1802. <i>Bonaparte</i> is the story of how Napoleon became Napoleon. A future volume will trace his career as emperor.</p><p>Most books approach Napoleon from an angle&#x2015;the Machiavellian politician, the military genius, the life without the times, the times without the life. Gueniffey paints a full, nuanced portrait. We meet both the romantic cadet and the young general burning with ambition&#x2015;one minute helplessly intoxicated with Josephine, the next minute dominating men twice his age, and always at war with his own family. Gueniffey recreates the violent upheavals and global rivalries that set the stage for Napoleon&#x2019;s battles and for his crucial role as state builder. His successes ushered in a new age whose legacy is felt around the world today.</p><p>Averse as we are now to martial glory, Napoleon might seem to be a hero from a bygone time.

[Gueniffey] writes with a powerful grounding in the intellectual history of late 18th-century France. One of the notable features of the book, and one that distinguishes it from the majority of biographies, is Gueniffey&#x2019;s concern to anchor his subject in the spirit of the times... It is the most detailed and analytical discussion yet published of his career from his first steps in the military to the moment in 1802 when he was proclaimed First Consul for life...

The author of several books on the period and an editor of Napoleon&#x2019;s letters, he was persuaded in 2004 to abandon a more limited project to undertake a full biography of his subject. Nine years later the first volume, which ends in 1802, was published in Paris and immediately won all the available plaudits. A second volume will follow in due course. When the work is complete there is little doubt that it will be accepted as the most authoritative biography of Napoleon that we have or are likely to have in the foreseeable future.

This one, of Italian novelist Dacia Maraini, is full of contradiction and as pungent as black olives grown in Mediterranean soil. Maraini journeys back to Bagheria, her Sicilian hometown, to make peace with family ghosts and revisit the place her heart calls home. Tea with her eccentric aunt at the old family villa inspires refreshingly acute perceptions of family history and foibles, precisely remembered. Maraini encounters her past in every room, photograph, conversation, and landscape. She decries the blight of modern Sicily, its urban sprawl, the destruction of its artistic and architectural treasures, and the ruin of her family's estates. Yet she rejects her family's aristocratic pretensions and has no interest in its survival. She paints her self-portrait in dry, suggestive brushstrokes, with the natural self-possession of the aristocratic bloodline she was so desperate to reject. Maraini's assessment of modern Sicily is also a personal condemnation, a rejection, and a purging. Disenchanted and out of step with the rigid traditions of family and culture, she remains an observer who comes to an uneasy acceptance of that which has formed her. <i>Deanna Larson</i></p><h2>East of the Sun, West of the Moon (Council Wars)</h2><p>When the council that controlled the world-spanning computer Mother fell out in civil war, it plunged the world in an instant from high-tech utopia to medieval nightmare.

Imagine a blend of old-fashioned role playing fantasy games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons crossed with contemporary adult video games like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, filtered through Ryan&#x2019;s sense of humor.<br><br> The book begins with C.F. (his full-name would be too horrifying to reveal here) being thrown into the Prison Pit, a barren negative-zone populated by intergalactic, violent monster criminals. In this first volume, C.F. gets into a bloody slorge war (a <em>slorge</em> is a giant slug that excretes a steroid-like drug called &#x201c;fecid&#x201d; that all the monster men are addicted to) with ultraprisoner Rottweiler Herpes and his henchmen Rabies Bloodbath and Assrat.

Before they leave, Doug's friend warns him to stay away from the shadowy woods or the "beasties" will get him. It's not long before the siblings are lured into an underground passage and meet up with the creatures. At this point, the hairs on readers' arms will start to rise and the plot takes the bizarre twist so familiar in Sleator's titles. Doug, presented with several dilemmas, is forced to make uncomfortable decisions without really understanding his choices. Using his trademark techniques, Sleator sets the scene within everyday situations, introduces unusual plot elements with vivid description, develops the story line by leading readers though a labyrinth, and builds to an explosive ending with a message. The Beasties follows this format and includes sibling rivalry, forest conservation, respect for those who are less valued or understood, choices and decisions, friendship, and a healthy dose of the creepy. This is a quick read, with lots of suspense, but its real effectiveness lies in the way it introduces and explores issues of human choice and compassion, and the lingering questions after the reading is complete. The Beasties invites discussion as it delves into issues for which there are no easy answers. Sure to be popular with the author's many fans and a good choice to introduce his work to others.?Molly S.

On the eve of D-Day, the 82nd Airborne Division parachuted into key positions along the Normandy coast, spearheading the assault on Fortress Europe. Using extensive firsthand interviews with the men of the 82nd, Ed Ruggero vividly brings them to life. This "first-rate story-teller" (<em>Denver Post</em>) weaves their improbable achievement into an unforgettable narrative.</p><p>Only one unit of the 82nd -- the 3,000 men of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment -- had previously been tested in battle. These heroes of the brutal 1943 invasion of Sicily -- whose story was brilliantly told in Ruggero's <em>Combat Jump</em> -- were given one of the toughest assignments, that of securing the critical crossroads town of Ste. Mï¿½re Eglise, the gateway to Utah Beach, through which half of the U.S. invasion force had to pass. Within hours of landing in Normandy, the 505th had accomplished its mission and seized Ste. Mï¿½re Eglise, the first town in Europe to be liberated. But as the sun rose on June 6, 1944, and as the assault waves struggled ashore on fire-swept beaches, the airborne commanders realized that most of the nearly 14,000 paratroopers dropped on the extreme right flank of the Allied invasion area had missed their targets.</p><p>The scattered troopers fought in small groups, cut off from one another by the dense Norman hedgerows and cleverly dug-in German defenders. Putting themselves between the vulnerable landing beaches and repeated enemy assaults, the lightly armed paratroopers fought for no-name crossroads and isolated fields on the first few miles of the long road to Berlin. Their training, courage, and leadership paid off; with their blood, they purchased the critical hours the Allies needed to get ashore. Often outnumbered and frequently outgunned, the men of the 82nd accomplished every mission, held every piece of ground they gained, and thus helped secure the success of the greatest amphibious invasion in history.</p></p><p><p></p><p>Ed Ruggero is the author of <em>Combat Jump: The Young Men Who Led the Assault into Fortress Europe, July 1943</em> and <em>Duty First: A Year in the Life of West Point and the Making of American Leaders</em>. He was an infantry officer in the United States Army for eleven years and is an experienced keynote speaker on leadership development. He lives in Wallingford, Pennsylvania.</p>Ruggero retraces the course of the storied 82nd Airborne Division as it jumped into occupied France on the night before June 6, 1944, in this vivid and often intimate account. Focusing on "those crucial first three days in France," he portrays the chaotic, often frantic fight, led by Maj. Gen. Matt Ridgway and Brig. Gen. Jim Gavin, to secure the critical roads and bridges leading to Utah Beach in order to prevent a German counterattack. Supreme Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower knew the dangers inherent in putting lightly armed paratroopers behind enemy lines&#x2014;casualties were projected at 70%&#x2014;but approved the operation since he believed the paratroopers were crucial to the assault. Despite missed drop zones, scattered units, lost equipment and fierce German resistance, the 82nd pulled together ad hoc units and proceeded to accomplish its mission with skill and uncommon valor. Relying on memoirs, histories and especially interviews with campaign veterans, Ruggero, a former infantry officer, draws on his skills as a novelist (<i>The Academy</i>) and historian (<i>Combat Jump</i>) to deliver a moving portrait of the service and sacrifices of the U.S. Army's first airborne division. <i>(June 1)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The demise of the plantation has been pronounced many times, but the large industrial farms survive as significant parts of, not just the South's, but the nation's agriculture."In this sweeping historical and geographical account, Aiken traces the development of the Southern cotton plantation since the Civil War--from the emergence of tenancy after 1865, through its decline during the Depression, to the post-World War Two development of the large industrial farm.</p><p>Tracing the geographical changes in plantation agriculture and the plantation regions after 1865, Aiken shows how the altered landscape of the South has led many to the false conclusion that the plantation has vanished. In fact, he explains, while certain regions of the South have reverted to other uses, the cotton plantation survives in a form that is, in many ways, remarkably similar to that of its antebellum predecessors.</p><p>Aiken also describes the evolving relationship of African-Americans to the cotton plantation during the thirteen decades of economic, social, and political changes from Reconstruction through the War on Poverty -- including the impact of alterations in plantation agriculture and the mass migration of Southern blacks to the urban North during the twentieth century.</p><p>Richly illustrated with more than 130 maps and photographs (many original and many from FSA photographers), The Cotton Plantation South is a vivid and colorful account of landscape, geography, race, politics, and civil rights as they relate to one of America's most enduring and familiar institutions.</p></p><p><p>Charles S. Aiken is professor of geography at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.</p><p>"A brief review can only hint at Aiken's exciting, original, and insightful contributions. This splendid book deserves to be read, discussed, and debated among all serious students of southern history." -- Harold D. Woodman, Journal of Southern History</p><br><br><p>"Any serious student of the geography of the United States will want to have it in their library." -- Richard H.

Although he passed away in 1990, his popularity continues to increase as his fantastic novels, including <em>The Witches</em> and<em> Matilda</em>, delight an ever-growing legion of fans. </p>Richard E. Grant uses a full range of tones and tempos to create distinct voices for all the characters in this story of Billy's encounter with the Ladderless Window-Cleaning Company. Grant's Pelly speaks with a speech impediment and a singsong rhythm; his monkey is slightly breathless, but, sadly, his giraffe does not sound female as the text clearly indicates. Grant shines when various characters sing; his portrayal of the opera star turned duchess singing about her stolen diamonds is a particular delight. Grant's straightforward narration lets Dahl's droll language and dialogue take center stage. This winning production will make the whole family smile.

A&nbsp;&nbsp;frame of microfilm surgically implanted beneath the&nbsp;&nbsp;flesh of his hip. Evidence that plastic surgery has&nbsp;&nbsp;altered his face. Strange things that he says in&nbsp;&nbsp;his delirium -- maybe code words.&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial: "J.B." And a number on the film negative that&nbsp;&nbsp;leads to a Swiss bank account, a fortune of four&nbsp;&nbsp;million dollars, and, at last, a name: Jason Bourne.&nbsp;&nbsp;But now he is marked for death, caught in a&nbsp;&nbsp;maddening puzzle, racing for survival through the deep&nbsp;&nbsp;layers of his buried past into a bizarre world of&nbsp;&nbsp;murderous conspirators -- led by Carlos, the world's&nbsp;&nbsp;most dangerous assassin. And no one can help Jason&nbsp;&nbsp;Bourne but the woman who once wanted to escape&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p><h2>The Bobbin Lace Manual</h2><p>Step-by-step instructions, carefully graded projects for creating Torchon, Bedfordshire, Braided, Modern, other exquisite laces. 26 new patterns in all, including eye-catching motifs for bookmarks, edgings, inserts, corners, and medallions. 229 illustrations, including over 50 3-color stitch diagrams.<br></p><p></p><h2>Sex and World Peace</h2><p><i>Sex and World Peace</i> unsettles a variety of assumptions in political and security discourse, demonstrating that the security of women is a vital factor in the security of the state and its incidence of conflict and war. <br><br>The authors compare micro-level gender violence and macro-level state peacefulness in global settings, supporting their findings with detailed analyses and color maps. Harnessing an immense amount of data, they call attention to discrepancies between national laws protecting women and the enforcement of those laws, and they note the adverse effects on state security of abnormal sex ratios favoring males, the practice of polygamy, and inequitable realities in family law, among other gendered aggressions. <br><br>The authors find that the treatment of women informs human interaction at all levels of society. Their research challenges conventional definitions of security and democracy and shows that the treatment of gender, played out on the world stage, informs the true clash of civilizations. In terms of resolving these injustices, the authors examine top-down and bottom-up approaches to healing wounds of violence against women, as well as ways to rectify inequalities in family law and the lack of parity in decision-making councils. Emphasizing the importance of an R2PW, or state responsibility to protect women, they mount a solid campaign against women's systemic insecurity, which effectively unravels the security of all.</p><p><i>Sex and World Peace</i> argues that the security of women is a vital factor in the overall security of the state and its incidence of conflict and war.

Yet much of the O&#x2019;Malley story leading up to the Dodgers&#x2019; move is unknown or created from myth, and there is substantially more to the man. When he entered the public eye, the self-constructed family background and early life he presented was gilded. Later his personal story was distorted by some New York sportswriters, who hated him for moving the Dodgers.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;In <i>Mover and Shaker</i> Andy McCue presents for the first time an objective, complete, and nuanced account of O&#x2019;Malley&#x2019;s life. He also departs from the overly sentimentalized accounts of O&#x2019;Malley as either villain or angel and reveals him first and foremost as a rational, hardheaded businessman, who was a major force in baseball for three decades and whose management and marketing practices radically changed the shape of the game.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Andy McCue is the author of <i>Baseball by the Books: The Complete History and Bibliography of Baseball Fiction </i>and is a former president of the Society for American Baseball Research.<p><br></p><p>&#x201c;Andy McCue has written the definitive biography of the fascinating and elusive Walter O&#x2019;Malley, the man who changed the way a country thinks about its national pastime.

Tapenade (ta-pen-AHD) is a kind of Mediterranean relish made from olives and capers. It has a bitingly fresh and rich f lavor that perks up just about anything. I like to spread it on crackers or slather it over grilled tuna steaks, pork tenderloin, or lamb chops. Try it on Bruschetta (page 60). It goes almost anywhere&#x2013;snack, dip, topping for main dish. Tapenade is a good basic spread to have at a tailgate. The proportions here make over 3 cups but it keeps in the fridge for a month or two. Halve the recipe if you want less. Don&#x2019;t use canned olives&#x2013;they have a metallic taste.<br><br></i><b>MAKES ABOUT 3 1/2 CUPS <br><br></b>2 cups pitted black olives, preferably oil-cured, niï¿½oise, or kalamata<b><br></b>1/4<b> </b>cup drained capers<br>1 can (2 ounces) anchovies, rinsed and patted dry<br>2 garlic cloves, chopped <br>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil<br>Juice of 1/2 lemon<br>1 tablespoon fresh thyme<br>3 cups loosely packed fresh parsley <br>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper<br><br><b>BEFORE YOU GO:</b> Put everything in a food processor and blend until finely minced but not completely pureed, about 20 seconds. Spoon into a serving bowl or zipper-lock bag, cover or seal, and chill in refrigerator or cooler. <br><br><b>WHEN YOU GET THERE:</b> Remove from cooler 20 minutes before serving or using. <br><br><b>NEIGHBORLY TIP </b>If you don&#x2019;t like anchovies, replace them with 11&#x2044;2 cups pine nuts.<br><b><i>Basil Pesto</i></b><br><br><i>Here&#x2019;s another all-purpose spread, topping, and sauce. Spoon it over grilled salmon. Make it the sauce for pizza, or use it as a sandwich spread. Sure, you could buy the jarred stuff, but homemade is so much better. Pesto takes less than 5 minutes to make and it keeps frozen for months. I make it in August or September when fresh basil is easy to find. Then I just freeze it in a tub and scoop out whatever I need. </i><br><br><b>MAKES ABOUT 2 1/4 CUPS </b><br><br>2 large garlic cloves, coarsely chopped <br>10 cups loosely packed fresh basil <br>2 cups grated imported Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese<br>3/4 cup pine nuts <br>1 teaspoon salt<br>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper <br>1 cup extra virgin olive oil <br><br><b>BEFORE YOU GO:</b> Put everything but oil in a food processor. Blend until finely chopped, about 30 seconds. Scrape down sides of processor bowl, then add 3/4 cup of the oil and blend to a loose paste, about 20 seconds, scraping bowl as necessary. For a more runny pesto, blend in remaining oil a tablespoon at a time until thinned how you like it. Scrape into two small airtight containers and chill up to 1 week or freeze up to 1 year. Two containers allow you to carry just 1 cup of pesto at a time, since you&#x2019;ll rarely need 2 cups. <br><br><b>WHEN YOU GET THERE:</b> If the pesto is frozen, use a melon baller or spoon to scrape out the amount you need; small pieces will melt quickly when they meet hot foods. Or thaw and remove from cooler 20 minutes before using as a spread or dip. <br><br><b>NEIGHBORLY TIP</b> If you&#x2019;ll only use a small amount of pesto at a time, drop the prepared pesto in 1-tablespoon blobs onto wax-paper-lined cookie sheets. Freeze until solid, then pop off the blobs and seal in a zipper-lock bag. That way you have 1-tablespoon amounts ready to go.<br><b><i>Spinach Artichoke Bread Bowl </i></b><br><i>Versions of this warm dip have become standard bar food around the country. And, to me, tailgating is like being at an outdoor bar. Here&#x2019;s some bar food for the party&#x2013; served in a bread bowl. All the prep is done at home, then you just reheat the dip onsite. </i><br><br><b>MAKES 12 SERVINGS </b><br><br>1 tablespoon olive oil<br>1/2 cup finely chopped red onion <br>1 large garlic clove, minced<br>1/2 cup mayonnaise <br>1 container (8 ounces) sour cream, about 1 cup <br>1 jar (6 ounces) marinated artichoke hearts, drained and finely chopped <br>1 package (10 ounces) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry<br>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese<br>1/4 teaspoon salt<br>1/4 teaspoon paprika <br>2 small round or oblong loaves pumpernickel or sourdough bread (about 1 pound each) <br><br><b>BEFORE YOU GO: </b>Warm oil in medium saucepan over medium heat. When hot, add onion and garlic. Cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in remaining ingredients, except bread. Cook until heated through. Cover and chill in refrigerator or cooler up to 2 days. <br><br>The morning of the tailgate, cut one loaf of bread into 1-inch cubes and put in zipper-lock bag. Make a bread bowl with other loaf: Cut out top of loaf as if making a jack-o&#x2019;-lantern out of a pumpkin. Remove bread from inside, leaving 1-inch shell of crust. Cut removed bread into 1-inch cubes, add to zipper-lock bag, and seal. Seal bread bowl in another zipper-lock bag.<br><br><b>WHEN YOU GET THERE: </b>Reheat dip over medium-low heat, stirring now and then, until hot, 5 to 8 minutes. Scrape dip into bread bowl and serve with bread cubes. <br><br><b>NEIGHBORLY TIPS</b> Keep the dip warm a little longer by heating the bread bowl. Wrap bread bowl in heavy-duty foil and put on a medium-low covered grill until warm and just crisp on the crust, about 5 minutes per side. Unwrap and fill with the warm dip. <br><br>If you&#x2019;re watching calories, use low-fat mayo and sour cream. But, remember, fat is a tailgater&#x2019;s friend. It helps to keep you warm on those chilly December days.</p><h2>American Dreams: The Story of a Jewish Immigrant Family</h2><p>At the beginning of the twentieth century a Jewish family leaves Poland and makes the sociological and economic adjustment to life in the New World.</p><p></p><h2>A Celebration of Customs &amp; Rituals of the World</h2><p>Explores initiation rites, wedding feasts, harvest celebrations, religious rituals, and many other customs used around the world to mark all kinds of special occasions.</p><p>The title says it: a lavishly illustrated encyclopedia of traditional and contemporary customs and rituals representing cultures from every corner of the globe. In a clearly written text, Wilkinson (The Master Builders, 1994, etc.) makes sense of the variety of rites that accompany significant events in life, including childbirth, holidays, weddings, harvest, religious and artistic celebrations, and funerals. Ingpen demonstrates the universality of these rituals in beautiful montage illustrations; e.g., in the coverage of wedding dances, he depicts the Wodaabe men of Niger, Czech married women, and Cajun bridesmaids. Author and illustrator consistently attempt to stand outside their own culture, eschewing ethnocentrism, to convey the meaning of the ceremonial and spiritual ties that bind all people. In a world where religious, racial, and cultural differences often lead to conflict, this book may convince readers that what cultures share, through ritual and custom, is much more important than what divides them.

Whether located in the Australian outback or the court of Queen Elizabeth II, human societies share a rich tradition of ceremonies marked by fascinating customs and rituals. Divided into four large topics, this survey highlights how we celebrate birth, coming-of-age (male and female), marriage, death, and other important passages. Common rituals like eating and gift giving are covered as well. Rich full-color illustrations, some of them showing partial nudity, and detailed captions help bring more meaning to these sometimes complex ceremonies. <i>Denia Hester</i></p><h2>Yesterday&#39;s Son (Star Trek S.)</h2><p>1st Titan edition paperback, fine condition.

Sam made a name for himself one day by jumping seventy feet into the tumultuous waters below Pawtucket Falls. When in 1827 he repeated the stunt in Paterson, New Jersey, another mill town, an even larger audience gathered to cheer on the daredevil they would call the &#x201c;Jersey Jumper.&#x201d; Inevitably, he went to Niagara Falls, where in 1829 he jumped not once but twice in front of thousands who had paid for a good view.<br><br>The distinguished social historian Paul E. Johnson gives this deceptively simple story all its deserved richness, revealing in its characters and social settings a virtual microcosm of Jacksonian America. He also relates the real jumper to the mythic Sam Patch who turned up as a daring moral hero in the works of Hawthorne and Melville, in London plays and pantomimes, and in the spotlight with Davy Crockett&#x2014;a Sam Patch who became the namesake of Andrew Jackson&#x2019;s favorite horse.<br><br>In his shrewd and powerful analysis, Johnson casts new light on aspects of American society that we may have overlooked or underestimated. This is innovative American history at its best.<br></p><p>"On Friday, November 13, 1829, a cheering crowd watched a drunken factory hand named Sam Patch step bravely off the top of Genesee Falls at Rochester, New York&#x2014;and vanish into legend. In this compact masterpiece of historical detective work, Paul Johnson manages both to bring this unlikely early American hero back to vivid life, and to say a good many fresh and provocative things about Jacksonian America, the industrial revolution and the cult of celebrity." &#x2014;Geoffrey C. Ward, author of A First-Class Temperament: The Emergence of Franklin D. Roosevelt <p>"With this little masterpiece, Paul Johnson proves yet again that he is one of the greatest artists currently writing history anywhere. Scholar, stylist, and intellectual daredevil, Johnson brings to life a forlorn and intrepid American hero&#x2014;and an entire era in our past&#x2014;while operating at the highest levels of subtlety, wit, and seriousness. Sam Patch, the Famous Jumper contains the kind of genius one expects from fine literature as well as from fine history. It is stunning." &#x2014;Sean Wilentz, Princeton University </p><p>"Nudged forward by Paul Johnson's consummate storytelling, the reader plunges headlong into the raging torrents of antebellum America, where manly artisans thrash about with scheming capitalists, incorrigible wastrels with prim reformers. Having taken the leap, the reader will find, as Sam Patch did, that you cannot go back. This is a wonderful, clever book." &#x2014;Mark C. Carnes, Barnard College, Columbia University</p><b>Paul E.

The spiral-bound book, one in a series of five, contains recipes for soups, desserts, muffins, breads, appetizers, salads, drinks and more. Millang, originally from Louisiana, began writing cookbooks in the early 1980s as a hobby. Her first book, full of Cajun recipes, was self-published and sold around Minneapolis. "That's when Cajun cooking was really hot: ' Millang said. "So I thought, 'Well, I'm Cajun, so I can do that.'" Millang then found a publisher to print her postcard- formatted book, "The Muffin are Coming" "That one did really well. We sold 76,000 copies," she said. "Usually if you sell 3,000 you're doing pretty well." Today, 14 books and one publisher later, Millang is seeing much success. Her fruit series includes books on blueberries, rhubarb, apples, cherries, cranberries, and the latest, "The Joy of Strawberries: ' is currently being printed. Millang said she plans to continue writing cookbooks and has several ideas for books already in the works. "I'm always into something," she said.

Gen. Frank E. Petersen</h2><p>In 1950, when Frank E. Petersen left Topeka to see the world, he never dreamed that the next thirty-years would fly him from seaman recruit to the heights of command as a Marine Corps three-star general.</p><p>Like many 18-year-olds who sign up to serve with the U.S. Navy, Petersen was looking for adventure when he enlisted. The difference between him and the average kid of 1950, when he enlisted, was that Petersen was African American. At the time military opportunities were limited for blacks, so it was remarkable that Petersen?revealed here as an intense go-getter?was admitted to the highly competitive naval aviation cadet program. He would go on to become the first African American pilot, then flag officer, then three-star general in the deeply conservative Marine Corps. Assisted by veteran biographer Phelps (They Had a Dream), Petersen relates his personal and career trajectory from wide-eyed kid to seasoned combatant. Although the presentation at times is overly detailed, with recollections of Petersen's acquaintances sprinkled liberally throughout ("Yeah, I remember Frank..."), this work offers valuable insight into the evolution of both the military and the society at large through the experience of one man and his family. It's hard not to wince when Petersen describes being stopped for impersonating a military officer at a time when blacks in the service were presumed to be enlisted men. Other anecdotes are more benign, such as the time a puzzled young Korean woman tried to wipe the color from his face. To Petersen's credit, he includes much commentary from his first wife, Ellie, who is candid about the toll of being married to an ambitious pioneer. Through her, readers see the mettle of that rare breed of social groundbreakers. Photos. (Dec.) FYI: This month, two other books analyze African Americans in the military?Gerald Astor's The Right to Fight (Forecasts, Oct. 19) and Theodore Taylor's The Flight of Jesse Leroy Brown (Forecasts, Oct. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Petersen joined the navy at 18 in 1950 and managed to be selected for flight training. Although the armed services were, technically, integrated in 1948, he spent most of his time, it seems, fighting genteel and not-so-genteel opposition from whites who, in words like those we hear now about women in the military, claimed that the armed forces were being sacrificed for the sake of the "social experiment" of fully incorporating someone besides white males. He persevered, surviving two wars (against foreign enemies, that is), thousands of hours in cockpits, hate mail that has to be read to be believed (and then, one doesn't like to), a divorce, and many other challenges. He retired as the senior marine aviator, the "Silver Eagle," and the first black marine general. It would be hard to imagine a man who has deserved better of his country, and without his story, there would be formidable gaps in several areas of American history. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>Sulphides the Art of Cameo Incrustation</h2><p>Sulphides--The Art of Cameo Incrustation by Paul Jokelson <p>A lavishly illustrated treatise on the art of encasing cameos in crystal.

In one alternative world, instead of the grim authoritarian and autarkic states of the East, socialist revolution in the world&#39;s most advanced economies ushers in an era of global peace, progress and prosperity, with global federations substituting for nation-states and international organisations.

As usual, coverage is primarily visual, with brief introductory text and informative captions. The account starts with an overall perspective showing how volcanoes and earthquakes occur, with related events like steam vents and boiling mud. Effects on humans and attempts to measure and predict these events are treated. Even volcanism on other planets (mostly their moons) is shown. The striking photographs include a shot of a Philippine town dusted by Mount Pinatubo; the people's colorful clothes clash with the ashy whitness covering all the houses and the ash-darkened sky. In another spread the ash cloud from Mount St. Helens can be seen rushing down the mountainside in three successive photos.

He lives in Berkeley, California. For a complete list of all of Todd's books and more information, visit www.toddparr.com.PreS. Using pure colors and elemental shapes outlined in black, Parr tells the story of dog-boy Otto. Unlike so many picture books' animal heroes, Otto has as many canine characteristics as human ones. He gets dressed and rides the school bus, but in class he learns how to wag his tail without knocking things over, and when he waits his turn for the bathroom, he is on all fours. Although text and art are simple in the extreme, young kids may be a bit befuddled by Otto's identity permutations; unlike adults, they probably won't have confronted the question, if Pluto and Goofy are both dogs, why does only Goofy wear clothes? Children who are able to grasp the concept will find things to like, and Parr's last-page message adds support for a new experience: "The first day of school is fun and exciting. You will make new friends, learn new things, and you will be really smart." <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

The year is 1972: Britain, confronting economic disaster, is being torn apart by industrial unrest and Irish terrorism and faces its fifth state of emergency. The Cold War has entered a moribund phase but the fight goes on and MI5 hesitates at little<br>to influence hearts and minds.&nbsp;<br><br>Serena, a compulsive reader of novels, is sent by her new employers on a secret mission that brings her into the literary world of Tom Haley, a promising young writer.

But in the dark and troubled Cold War days in London, there were few options for bright young women. So when a mysterious lover recruits her for the British intelligence service, MI5, Serena throws herself body and soul into an undercover operation code-named Sweet Tooth. What unfolds is a mystery, a romance, and a dazzling display of literary workmanship. Though the action slows to a crawl at times, McEwan is a brilliant and entertaining storyteller whose lines--sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, sometimes wickedly wise--had me reaching for my highlighter. --<i>Neal Thompson</i>IAN MCEWAN is the bestselling author of 14 books, including the novels <i>Solar</i>; <i>On Chesil Beach</i>; <i>Saturday</i>; <i>Atonement</i>, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award and the W.

Pub. 654, Woody-Plant Seed Manual. The manuscript was ready for publication in 1941, but World War Ii delayed publication until 1948. The boom in tree planting in the 1950s and 1960s created a large demand for seeds and exposed the gaps in our knowledge concerning production and quality of seeds of woody plants in general. The 1974 Handbook proved to be very popular both in this country and abroad, leading to five printings and translations in several other languages. More than a quarter-century after its publication, however, numerous advances in tree seed technology have dictated that a new revision is needed; the result is the current volume. Part I contains information on how to get seeds and raise seedlings.

Giamatti begins with the conviction that our use of free time tells us something about who we are. He explores the concepts of leisure, American-style. And in baseball, the quintessential American game, he finds its ultimate expression. "Sports and leisure are our reiteration of the hunger for paradise- for freedom untrammeled." Filled with pithy truths about such resonant subjects as ritual, self-betterment, faith, home, and community, <i>Take Time for Paradise</i> gives us much more than just baseball. These final, eloquent thoughts of "the philosopher king of baseball" (Seattle Weekly) are a joyful, reverent celebration of the sport Giamatti loved and the country that created it.</p></p><p><p>A. Bartlett Giamatti served as commissioner of Major League Baseball from April 1, 1989, until his death on September 1, 1989.

Introduction by Percy Adams.<br></p><p></p><h2>Influenza 1918</h2><p>Looks at the impact of this viral epidemic that forced businesses, schools, and churches to close, and describes how individuals and public officials reacted to the health crisis</p><p>By conservative estimates, the influenza pandemic of 1918 killed 21 million to 40 million people around the world, 675,000 of them in the United States. After only 17 months, the mortality was half that attributed to the 4-year span of the Black Death in 14th-century Europe and Asia. To many, "Spanish" influenza ranks as the deadliest plague to afflict human beings in recorded history. Its origins were obscure, its pathologic features unique, and its consequences, coming in the midst of the American entry into World War I, almost unendurable. In the panic that ensued, churches and schools were closed, the Army canceled the draft, corpses overflowed mass graves in Philadelphia, and black wreaths hung from virtually every door. Influenza 1918 recounts these statistics with the clarity of a tocsin.<p> Even more affecting are the stories of children, now in their 80s and 90s, whose pastoral reminiscences about Sunday picnics and Thrift stamps darken at the memory of lost friends, parents, siblings, and entire families. This book, adapted in part from the information televised in The American Experience, examines with a documentarian's eye the portraits of individual Americans against the canvas of the global pandemic. </p><p> The tracing of the nearly simultaneous eruptions of influenza in coastal Spain (in February 1918) and Fort Riley, Kansas (in March 1918), is complicated by the disease's wildfire proliferation across Europe as troops in trenches, hospitals, and overloaded transports spread the infection. In April and May 1918, the disease spread through Spain and the rest of Europe, but it remained quiescent in the United States until September, when explosive illness ravaged the East Coast. Continental epidemics in Africa, South America, India, and Australia followed. A time line summarizing these outbreaks might have been helpful to the reader; although they make for an effective journalistic portrayal of the simultaneity of foci, the book's rapid-fire shifts from Europe to the United States, then to India and Australia may be confusing to some readers. The book reads like a modern newscast, with rapid cutting from one scene to the next and brief but memorable sound bites from witnesses. </p><p> However, many of the scientific questions that would occur to the lay reader, not to mention the medical expert, are left unanswered. For example, what was the origin of the virus? The book breathes mystery: "A chance encounter occurred. Perhaps between a duck and a pig. Perhaps between a duck and a man, woman, or child. Perhaps between a pig and a man." But scientific evidence has demonstrated that partial sequences from 5 of the virus's 10 genes and the entire hemagglutinin sequence are much more akin to mammalian than to avian clades (J.K. Taubenberger, et al. Initial Genetic Characterization of the 1918 "Spanish" Influenza Virus. Science 1997;275:1793-6; and A.H. Reid, et al. Origin and Evolution of the 1918 "Spanish" Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin Gene. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 1999;96:1651-6). Some of this work is summarized in the epilogue, but at times a tendency toward sensationalism displaces fact. </p><p> Other readers might wish to know more about the manifestations of illness, which were described as horrifying, even in contemporaneous medical reviews. Much is made of the awful premonitions that heralded imminent collapse, of the cutaneous, genital, and pulmonary hemorrhages that appalled medical personnel, and of the astounding rapidity of death, but no extracts from medical reports published at the time are provided. In other examples, we are told variously that workers in gas and cordite factories, blacks in the South, and those with tuberculosis were mysteriously spared, but without precise footnoting, these statements appear undocumented. </p><p> Finally, almost all readers will ask, "Can this happen again?" No facts are presented to dispel this very reasonable concern. A brief discussion of international surveillance organizations -- even without mention of the nearly immediate identification of the avian variant of the Hong Kong flu in 1998 -- would have been appropriate. </p><p> The book vividly evokes the fear and terror sparked by the pandemic but discusses its clinical, epidemiologic, and virologic correlates cursorily. This is a great read for those attracted to the "you are there" approach, but in the end a dissatisfying one for those who want to know why, how, and whether again. </p><p> <i>Reviewed by Margaret K.

Here we have a typical Paulie letter. The apostle praises his correspondents for their Christian virtues, and rebukes them roundly for their many failings. He adds to their knowledge with some great passages, notably his discussion of love in chapter 13 and of the resurrection in chapter 15. Whatever he touches he deals with in the light of great Christian principles. He sees things temporal always in the light of things eternal. What he writes has relevance to our own, in many ways very different, needs.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Put-Downs and Zingers for All Occasions (Lines for All Occasions)</h2><p>You may be kind and intelligent, but that's no excuse for being a wimp out there on the schoolyard of life.

Simpson, a freelance journalist, reveals that many covert operations of the early Cold War era involved the use of operatives known to have committed crimes against humanity during the Second World War. The underlying theme here is the corruption of American ideals in connection with this hushed-up recruitment policy in the name of anticommunism. In elaborating the policy's "negative blowback," Simpson emphasizes the long-term corrosive effect on American intelligence agencies in particular. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.As the story of Andrija Artukovic, the high-ranking fascist Croatian who found refuge in the United States, and books by John Loftus, Howard Blum, and others tell us, a disgraceful chapter in U.S. Cold War history lies in the systematic use of Nazi and fascist war criminals to help the anti-Soviet aims of American intelligence and national security agencies. Germans and East Europeans were eagerly recruited into and rose to key positions in the Cold War crusade. Simpson's careful researchwhich underscores the part of the Catholic Church and reveals the role of George Kennan in this policyraises profound questions for scholars, lawmakers, and citizens alike.

Their clever and imaginative owners have found so many delightful ways to retain that old-fashioned charm while not at all sacrificing modern comfort. In Cornwall, little staircase windows in thick cob walls display a selection of 19th-century bottles. A Devon home still has a log-burning stove. The washhouse of an Oakhurst cottage allows a glimpse of another century. The fruits of a countrywide search, from Berwick-upon-Tweed to the Lizard peninsula, all these cottages show both those quirky imperfections and beguiling architectural details that reveal poignant reminders of past generations.<br></p><p>Hugh Lander is a specialist writer on the history and treatment of old buildings, and is the author of several books, including Do&#39;s and Don&#39;ts of House and Cottage Restoration and The House Restorer&#39;s Guide.

But he was also a prolific writer who published dozens of essays and reviews and several volumes of poetry and prose. The autobiographical account of his life in the manuscript collection of Yaleï¿½s Beinecke Library has often been consulted by scholars and curators writing about Hartley. It is the most revealing document he left about his personal life and relationships&#x2014;both for its disclosures and omissions&#x2014;but has never been published before.<br> <br> Transcribed from Hartleyï¿½s own handwritten manuscripts, this edition is accompanied by photographs (some never before published), notes, and an introduction discussing Hartleyï¿½s fascination with autobiography in the context of his struggle with notions of self-representation in art. Susan Ryan also describes the circumstances surrounding the composition of <i>Somehow a Past</i>, and explains the distinctions between this original version and two later ones also in the Beinecke Library.<br> <br> <i>Somehow a Past</i> is compelling both as historical document and as personal narrative. Although solitary, self-involved, and saturnine, Hartley nevertheless knew nearly every figure of the international avant-garde in his day and unfolds his life largely through a chain of personal encounters. His traffic with such major literary and artistic figures as Alfred Stieglitz, Vasili Kandinski, Gertrude Stein, Mabel Dodge, Eugene Oï¿½Neill, Robert McAlmon, and Charles Demuth is recorded as are his travels both domestic and foreign.<br> <br> <i>Somehow a Past</i> is gossipy, discursive, and self-distanced. Hartley drafted it several times, truncating the description of his traumatic childhood, and leaving out any overt reference to his homosexuality. Yet there are moments of crystal clear self-characterization and leitmotifs that commemorate his troubled youth.</p><p>This tender book, carefully edited by Susan Elizabeth Ryan, was chosen from among six handwritten manuscripts of the same title by the prolific American modernist painter and writer Marsden Hartley. Hartley "presents the scholar with an untidy field of inquiry," Ryan writes gently. Partly inspired by his friend Gertrude Stein's "autobiography" of Alice B. Toklas, it tells the story of a life at the center of the early modernist art movement in America, chiefly among the Alfred Stieglitz crowd. For this book, Ryan, in an extensive introduction, fills in many blanks, such as Hartley's homosexuality and the extreme sadness of his childhood after his mother's death when he was 8. The main text is a model of intellectual inquiry, self-doubt, and frequently mordant observations: "The summer in Paris was gay and amusing--there is always one summer in Paris when it is that." Or, "O, the wild rough gaiety of the Marseillaises when they are not murdering and thieving." <i>--Margaret Moorman</i>Susan Elizabeth Ryan is Assistant Professor of Art History, Louisiana State University.</p><h2>Uplands;: New poems</h2><p><p><strong>This book collects many of the poems that A. R. Ammons wrote between 1964 and 1970. The poems here include brief lyrics and such longer works as "Summer Session 1968" and "Guitar Recicativos."</strong></p> The critic Harold Bloom writes, "With the publication of his <em>Selected Poems</em> (1968), soon after turning forty, A. R. Ammons quietly demonstrated a unique and central position in recent American poetry. . . . Recognition, as is always the case with a poetry difficult and central, has come slowly, but critics now begin to see in Ammons what he is: the maker of a body of poetry that fulfills Emerson's prophecy by addressing itself to life 'with sufficient plainness and with sufficient profoundness.'"</p><p>A. R. Ammons&#x2019;s (1926&#x2013;2001) was a two-time winner of the National Book Award and the recipient of a National Book Critics Circle Award.

Written over twenty years, this poetic epic&#x2014;part libretto, part captivity epistle&#x2014;makes the past present, and even its sorrows sing.<br><br>In &#x201c;Buzzard,&#x201d; the opening section, we hear from the African interpreter for the rebels, mostly from Sierra Leone, who were captured on their winding attempt to sail home and were jailed in New Haven. In &#x201c;Correspondance,&#x201d; we encounter the remarkable letters to John Quincy Adams and others that the captives write from jail, where abolitionists taught them English while converting them to Christianity. In lines profound and pointed, the men demand their freedom in their newfound tongue: &#x201c;All we want is make us free.&#x201d; The book culminates in &#x201c;Witness,&#x201d; a libretto chanted by Cinque, the rebel leader, who yearns for his family and freedom while eloquently evoking the Amistads&#x2019; conversion and life in &#x201c;Merica.&#x201d; <br><br>As Young conjures this array of history and music, interweaving the liberation cry of Negro spirituals and the indoctrinating wordplay of American primers, he delivers his signature songlike immediacy at the service of a tremendous epic built on the ironies, violence, and virtues of American history. Vivid and true, <i>Ardency </i>is a powerful meditation on who we&#x2019;ve been and who we are.</p><p><b>Kevin Young</b> is the author of six previous collections of poetry and editor of five others. <i>Jelly Roll</i> was a finalist for the National Book Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, and won the Paterson Poetry Prize; <i>For the Confederate Dead </i>won<i> </i>the 2007 Quill Award for poetry.

Blending expert analysis, specially commissioned artwork and illustrative maps, this book tells the story of a quintessential example of Coastal attack and defense. Cherbourg was recognized by both The German and Allied High commands as crucial to the Allied foothold in Normandy - it was the nearest major port and was desperately needed by the Allies for major logistical operations to support their forces on long stretches of open beach. Hitler, on the other hand, declared Cherbourg to be a &#39;Festung&#39; (fortress), a designation everyone knew to mean that its defenders were to fight to the last man. After a gruelling struggle involving several distinct tactical phases designed to overcome the different elements of Cherbourg&#39;s defence, the campaign resulted in a bittersweet Allied victory, the drama and significance of which are explained in full in this work.</p><p>Steven J. Zaloga received his BA in History from Union College and his MA from Columbia University. He has worked as an analyst in the aerospace industry for over two decades, covering missile systems and the international arms trade, and has served with the Institute for Defense Analyses, a federal think tank. He is the author of numerous books on military technology and military history, with an accent on the US Army in World War II as well as Russia and the former Soviet Union.

This compendium volume of two earlier books is fully revised and updated. The monarchy is one of Britain&#39;s longest surviving institutions -- as well as one of its most tumultuous and revered. In this masterful book, David Starkey looks at the monarchy as a whole, charting its magnificent history from Roman times, to the Wars of the Roses, the chaos of the Civil War, the fall of Charles I and Cromwell&#39;s emergence as Lord Protector -- all the way up until the Victorian era when Britain&#39;s monarchs came face-to-face with modernity. This brilliant book, in part a collection of biographies of Britain&#39;s kings and queens, provides an in-depth examination of what the British monarchy has meant, what it means now and what it will continue to mean. Bringing to life a cast of colourful characters, Starkey&#39;s trademark energy and authority make him the perfect guide on this epic, accessible and compelling journey, as he offers us a vivid portrait of British culture, politics and nationhood through an institution that has defined the realm for nearly two thousand years.</p><p><p>From one of our finest historians comes an outstanding exploration of the British monarchy from the retreat of the Romans up until the modern day.</p><p>The monarchy is one of Britain&#x2019;s most venerable and revered institutions &#x2013; but also one of its most volatile.

Reissue.</p><p>From Kurzman (Fatal Voyage, A Killing Wind, etc.), a telling rundown on a WW II disaster that seldom rates more than a footnote in standard chronicles. On the night of November 12, 1942, a small American flotilla engaged in a furious battle with Japanese warships off Guadalcanal. The next morning, while the surviving US vessels were limping toward safe harbor, a torpedo from an undetected submarine slammed into the already crippled Juneau. The missile touched off below- deck explosions that sent the light cruiser to the bottom in seconds. Convinced that all hands had been lost, the task force commander maintained radio silence and cleared the area. As it happened, however, over 140 of the doomed ship's 700-man crew lived through the blast and were plunged into the shark-infested sea: when a belated rescue effort was launched almost a week later, there were only ten barely sane castaways left to save. Drawing on interviews with survivors and on archival sources, Kurzman offers harrowing tales of the ordeals experienced by the quick and the dead; among the latter were all five brothers from the Waterloo, Iowa, Sullivan family, who (against naval policy) had served together on a single craft. Addressed as well are the oversights and blunders that, despite repeated aerial sightings, delayed a systematic recovery operation that probably could have saved a hundred or more sailors. While punishments were quietly meted out to culpable officers, the author notes that the home front (diverted by sympathetic coverage of the Sullivans' loss) never received a full accounting of a calamity that ranks among the most agonizing in the annals of the US military. Kurzman's evenhanded and absorbing report not only bridges a long-standing gap in the history books but pays fitting tribute to those lost. (Photos--16 pages--not seen) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>On November 13, 1942, during the naval battle of Guadalcanal, a Japanese submarine torpedoed the cruiser U.S.S. Juneau , killing most of its 700-plus crew. Some 150 survivors watched in dismay as the rest of the task force sailed over the horizon, its commander, Captain Gilbert C. Hoover, having decided that it was too dangerous to pick them up. Due to communications foul-ups combined with gross negligence, rescuers did not arrive until eight days later, by which time only 10 Juneau crewmen remained alive. Kurzman's skillful recounting of the nightmarish events in the water, reconstructed from interviews with five of the survivors and with relatives of the other five will not be soon forgotten by readers--especially the horrifying shark frenzies. The book reveals details of the Navy's investigation and its decision to quietly bury the tragic story with this official statement: "Let the Juneau be remembered simply as the ill-fated ship on which the celebrated Sullivan brothers courageously died fighting when it went down, bringing new glory on the U.S. Navy." The author of the acclaimed Fatal Voyage: The Sinking of the U.S.S. Indianapolis has re-created another memorable disaster story. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Guardian</h2><p><b>The&nbsp;pulse-pounding sequel to&nbsp;<i>Proxy</i>!&nbsp;Inspired by <i>The Whipping Boy </i>and <i>Feed</i>, this adrenaline-fueled thriller will appeal to fans of&nbsp;<i>The&nbsp;Hunger Games&nbsp;</i>and <i>Divergent.</i></b><br><br>In the new world led by the Rebooters, former Proxy Syd is the figurehead of the Revolution, beloved by some and hated by others.

One by one, in the dead of night, green uniforms with white masks hauled corpses to the pile.

This Penguin Shakespeare edition is edited by T.J.B. Spencer with an introduction by Alan Sinfield. &#39;To be or not to be - that is the question&#39; Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. When young prince Hamlet is confronted by his father&#39;s ghost on the battlements of Castle Elsinore, he is burdened with a terrible task: slay King Claudius, Hamlet&#39;s uncle, who the ghost alleges murdered him. Wrestling with his conscience, Hamlet feigns wild madness while plotting a brutal revenge, alienating his mother Queen Gertrude and spurning his lover Ophelia. But the act of insanity takes Hamlet perilously close to the reality, wreaking havoc on guilty and innocent alike. This book contains a general introduction to Shakespeare&#39;s life and Elizabethan theatre, a separate introduction to Hamlet, a chronology, suggestions for further reading, an essay by Paul Prescott discussing performance options on both stage and screen, and a commentary. William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was born to John Shakespeare and Mary Arden some time in late April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon. He wrote about 38 plays (the precise number is uncertain), many of which are regarded as the most exceptional works of drama ever produced, including Romeo and Juliet (1595), Henry V (1599), Hamlet (1601), Othello (1604), King Lear (1606) and Macbeth (1606), as well as a collection of 154 sonnets, which number among the most profound and influential love-poetry in English. If you enjoyed Hamlet, you might like Shakespeare&#39;s Macbeth, also available in Penguin Shakespeare. &#39;It has everything - intrigue, romance, politics, violence, revenge, jealousy, wit. It plays itself out on such a grand scale&#39; Kenneth Branagh</p><p>This edition tells the story of Hamlet in production, from Burbage at the Globe to Branagh on film, relating stage interpretations to developments in the theatre, in literary criticism and in society. The detailed stage history records an ongoing process of discovery, as successive performers have found what it is in the play that will speak most powerfully to the audiences of their own times. The introduction focuses not only on star Hamlets, but on whole productions of the play including supporting players and, in this century, direction and design.This book is perfect for AP classes and is often selected for inclusion on the AP exam. The notes, reading pointers, and vocabulary in this addition will also help students at a lower reading level get the most out of these classics.</p><h2>Old Crimes, New Scenes: A Century of Innovations in Japanese Mystery Fiction</h2><p><p>By the late nineteenth century, Japanese readers had access to translations of many of Europe and America&#x2019;s best mystery writers. The popularity of the genre led to Japanese writers honestly translating these stories into Japanese; or to modifying the story according to the Japanese author&#x2019;s taste; and, sometimes to outright plagiarism of Western stories to be passed off as works by Japanese authors. The popularity of mysteries was ensured in Japan, and the ensuing century-plus has seen remarkable examples of Japanese literary innovation.<br>This volume highlights some of Japan&#x2019;s most creative responses to the mystery genre. Some of the works are innovative because they were written by authors (or, in one case, a poet) who did not normally write mysteries. Others are innovative for their variations on standard elements detective fiction, or for using mystery tropes to interrogate social norms such as social standing, or gender roles. Some works play on technological innovations as keys to the mystery. Some of the works are meta-fictive explorations of the mystery, using detective fiction to investigate detective fiction. <br>Scholars, students and mystery readers alike will find this volume full of surprises.</p></p><p></p><h2>Thayer&#39;s Life of Beethoven</h2><p><p>The book description for the previously published "Thayer's Life of Beethoven.

Yippee, fiddle-dee-fee! But they are not there for long. Horse, cow, donkey, pig, hen, and the other farm animals each eat one. "Save one for me," calls the farmer. But what about the farmer's wife?</p><p>Count on Pat Hutchins to solve the problem happily. And count&nbsp;the red apples before they are all gone!</p></p><p><p>Pat Hutchins, one of seven children, was born in Yorkshire, England, and grew up in the surrounding countryside, which she still loves. At a very early age she knew that she wanted to be an artist and was encouraged by an elderly couple who would give her a chocolate bar for each picture she drew. A local art school offered her a scholarship and she studied there for three years, continuing her training at Leeds College of Art, where she specialized in illustration. Her career in the children's book field began with the highly acclaimed <em>Rosie's Walk</em>, a 1968 ALA Notable Book. Since then she has written five novels and created more than twenty-five picture books. She was awarded England's prestigious Kate Greenaway Medal in 1974 for <em>The Wind Blew</em>. Pat Hutchins lives with her husband in London, England.</p>A farmer&#x2019;s bountiful apple tree is besieged by his hungry livestock in this lively countdown from the author of countless clever concept books. Rhyming verses tell the tale of the hapless farmer as he watches his animals gobble up his shining apples. The whole barnyard emerges one by one, from mighty horse to tiny hen, to sample the succulent fruit, emitting their distinctive calls when they&#x2019;re through. &#x201c;Duck came and ate one, / pick, pick, pick. / Quack, quack, fiddle-dee-fee.&#x201d; Each time a piece of fruit is consumed, the farmer counts the remaining apples, beseeching the animals to leave one for him. Every number has its own two-page spread, with the featured numeral in oversized red text and the appropriate number of apples lined up next to it. Hutchins&#x2019;s (Pink Pig, 1994) exuberant verses will have children chanting the refrain &#x201c;fiddle-dee-fee&#x201d; along with the farmer. Her vivid illustrations dazzle the eye with brilliant colors. A red outer border frames the pictures, which contain a festive row of sunny yellow flowers, running along the top and bottom of the page. The characters, both animal and human, resemble brightly colored wooden toys&#x2014;as if a child&#x2019;s toy set had suddenly become animated. The illustrated end pages provide additional counting practice for readers; counting up to ten on one side and down to one on the facing page. A welcome addition to the counting-book genre, Hutchins&#x2019;s playful tale is an edifying and energetic romp. (Picture book. 3-5) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½ 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

Pope Francis&#x2019;s stewardship of the Church, while perceived as a revelation by many, has provoked division throughout the world. &#x201c;If a conclave were to be held today,&#x201d; one Roman source told <i>The New Yorker</i>, &#x201c;Francis would be lucky to get ten votes.&#x201d;<br> <br>In <i>To Change the Church</i>, Douthat explains why the particular debate Francis has opened&#x2014;over communion for the divorced and the remarried&#x2014;is so dangerous: How it cuts to the heart of the larger argument over how Christianity should respond to the sexual revolution and modernity itself, how it promises or threatens to separate the church from its own deep past, and how it divides Catholicism along geographical and cultural lines. Douthat argues that the Francis era is a crucial experiment for all of Western civilization, which is facing resurgent external enemies (from ISIS to Putin) even as it struggles with its own internal divisions, its decadence, and self-doubt. Whether Francis or his critics are right won&#x2019;t just determine whether he ends up as a hero or a tragic figure for Catholics. It will determine whether he&#x2019;s a hero, or a gambler who&#x2019;s betraying both his church and his civilization into the hands of its enemies.</p><p>Ross Douthat is a columnist for&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>&nbsp;op-ed page. He is the author of&nbsp;<i>To Change the Church</i>,&nbsp;<i>Privilege</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Grand New Party</i>. Before joining <i>The&nbsp;</i><i>New York Times</i>,&nbsp;he was a senior editor for&nbsp;<i>The Atlantic</i>. He is the film critic for&nbsp;<i>National Review</i>, and he has appeared regularly on television, including&nbsp;<i>Charlie Rose</i>, PBS&nbsp;<i>NewsHour</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Real Time&nbsp;</i><i>with Bill Maher</i>.To Change the Church One<p></p> THE PRISONER OF THE VATICAN<p></p> <br>At the center of earthly Catholicism, there is one man: the Bishop of Rome, the Supreme Pontiff, the Vicar of Christ, the Patriarch of the West, the Servant of the Servants of God, the 266th (give or take an antipope) successor of Saint Peter.<br> <br>This has not changed in two thousand years. There was one bishop of Rome when the church was a persecuted minority in a pagan empire; one bishop of Rome when the church was barricaded into a Frankish redoubt to fend off an ascendant Islam; one bishop of Rome when the church lost half of Europe to Protestantism and gained a New World for its missionaries; one bishop of Rome when the ancien rï¿½gime crumbled and the church&#x2019;s privileges began to fall away; one bishop of Rome when the twentieth century ushered in a surge of growth and persecution for Christian faith around the globe.<br> <br>But all the other numbers that matter in Roman Catholicism have grown somewhat larger. When Simon Peter was crucified upside down in Nero&#x2019;s Rome, there were at most thousands of Christians in the Roman Empire, and only about 120 million human beings alive in the whole world. When Martin Luther nailed his theses to the Wittenberg door, there were only 50 or 60 million Christians in all of Europe. There were probably about 200 million Catholics worldwide when Pope Pius IX&#x2019;s Syllabus of Errors condemned modern liberalism in 1864; there were probably about 500 million a century later when the Second Vatican Council attempted a partial reconciliation with modernity.<br> <br>And now&#x2014;well, to start in the red-hatted inner circle, there are more than 200 cardinals, roughly 5,100 bishops, 400,000 priests, and about 700,000 sisters in the contemporary Catholic Church.1 In the United States alone, the number of people employed by the church in some form&#x2014;in schools and charities and relief organizations and the various diocesan bureaucracies&#x2014;tops a million.2 Worldwide, the church dwarfs other private sector and government employers, from McDonald&#x2019;s to the U.S. federal government to the People&#x2019;s Liberation Army.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s just the church as a corporation; the church as a community of believers is vastly larger. In 2014, one sixth of the world&#x2019;s human beings were baptized Catholics. Those estimated numbers? More than a billion and a quarter, or 1,253,000,000.<br> <br>Catholic means &#x201c;here comes everybody,&#x201d; wrote James Joyce in Finnegans Wake. That was in the 1920s, when there were about 300 million Catholics, two thirds of them in Europe.<br> <br>Now there are more Catholics in Latin America, more in Africa and Asia, than there were in all the Joycean world.<br> <br>ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½<br> <br>The papacy has never been an easy job. Thirty of the first thirty-one popes are supposed to have died as martyrs. Popes were strangled, poisoned, and possibly starved during the papacy&#x2019;s tenth-century crisis. Pius VI was exiled by French Revolutionary forces; his successor, Pius VII, was exiled by Napoleon. Pius XII&#x2019;s Rome was occupied by Nazis. Five popes at least have seen their city sacked&#x2014;by Vandals, Ostrogoths and Visigoths, Normans and a Holy Roman Emperor.<br> <br>These are extreme cases, but even the pleasure-loving pontiffs of the Renaissance found the office more punishing than they expected. &#x201c;Since God has given us the papacy, let us enjoy it,&#x201d; Giovanni di Lorenzo de&#x2019; Medici is supposed to have said upon being elected as Leo X. But his eight years as pope included a poisoning attempt, constant warfare, and the first days of the Reformation; he died at forty-five.<br> <br>Huns or Visigoths no longer menace today&#x2019;s popes, and their odds of being poisoned&#x2014;conspiracy theories notwithstanding&#x2014;are mercifully slim. But alongside the continued dangers of high office (the assassin&#x2019;s bullet that struck John Paul II, the Islamic State&#x2019;s dream of taking its jihad to Saint Peter&#x2019;s), there are new and distinctive pressures on the papacy. The speed of mass communications, the nature of modern media, means that popes are constantly under a spotlight, their every move watched by millions or billions of eyes. Papal corruption would be an international scandal rather than a distant rumor. Papal misgovernment leads to talk of crisis in every corner of the Catholic world. Papal illness or incapacity can no longer be hidden, and aging pontiffs face a choice between essentially dying in public, like John Paul II, or taking his successor&#x2019;s all-but-unprecedented step of resignation.<br> <br>In an age of media exposure, the pope&#x2019;s role as a public teacher is no longer confined to official letters, documents, bulls. Not just every sermon but every off-the-cuff utterance can whirl around the world before the Vatican press office has finished getting out of bed (or returned from an afternoon espresso). And theological experts are left to debate whether the magisterium of the church, that lofty-sounding word for official Catholic teaching, includes in-flight chats with reporters or &#x201c;private&#x201d; phone calls from the pope to members of the faithful.<br> <br>In past centuries the papacy&#x2019;s authority survived some of its worst occupants&#x2014;from the sixteenth-century Borgias to the tenth-century villain John XII, who allegedly raped and murdered pilgrims&#x2014;because their sins were out of sight and mostly out of mind for Catholics who didn&#x2019;t live in Rome or its environs. And across those same centuries, the papacy&#x2019;s claim to be a rock of unchanging teaching seemed more solid because casual papal utterances and speculations remained personal and private, with no iPhones to capture them, no Twitter to broadcast them to the world entire.<br> <br>Now, though, the pope is a global celebrity, with all the scrutiny that entails. And the Vatican has mostly encouraged this shift toward papal stardom. From the nineteenth century onward, as the papacy lost its claim to secular power and was besieged by revolutionaries and totalitarians, a papal cult was fostered among faithful Catholics, which treated the living occupants of Peter&#x2019;s see in a style usually reserved for long-departed saints. In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, as mass communication and airline travel expanded the papal presence further, actual papal canonizations became more commonplace. While the popes of the early church were almost all sainted, between the fall of Rome and the twentieth century, only thirty popes out of about two hundred were canonized. But two of the last five pontiffs have been declared saints, one has been beatified, and two have been declared Servants of God, the first step toward sainthood. And there will be a clamor (albeit from different camps among the Catholic faithful) for both the current pope and his still living predecessor to join those ranks once they&#x2019;ve passed to their reward.<br> <br>In fairness, recent popes probably have exceeded some of their medieval and modern predecessors in sanctity. But the trend still suggests an important transformation in how the papal office is presented and perceived, both among Catholics and in the wider world. The popes of the past struck monarchical poses and claimed sweeping political as well as spiritual powers. But with those claims came an implicit acknowledgment of their worldliness, which in turn invited lay Catholics to treat them as ordinary mortals&#x2014;sometimes corrupt, sometimes foolish, sometimes in need of hectoring and correction, and always at risk of eternal damnation. When Dante Alighieri&#x2019;s Divine Comedy consigned several popes to the Inferno, or when medieval painters of the Last Judgment made sure to place a tiara-sporting pontiff in the flames of hell, they were making a theological point about the nature and limits of the papal office. No matter how much power God had entrusted to the papacy, the popes&#x2019; personal sanctity was irrelevant to the church&#x2019;s central theological claims.<br> <br>This is still the official teaching of the church. But it is not the implication that one would draw from the way that the papacy is&#x2014;there is no other word for it&#x2014;marketed today, the way that each pope is treated not just as the supreme governor of the church but as its singular embodiment, the Catholic answer to Gandhi or Mandela, the Beatles or the Stones.<br> <br>With this marketing comes both outsize expectations and outsize vulnerability. Just as in American politics the president is handed both blame and credit for events that are far outside one man&#x2019;s control, so too the pope is treated like a minor deity, idolized by ultramontanists and cursed by anti-Catholics, and held responsible for good harvests and drowning floods alike.<br> <br>Thus where the church seems to be growing or reviving it must be &#x201c;the Francis effect&#x201d; or a &#x201c;John Paul II generation&#x201d; bearing fruit. Where Catholicism is in crisis or decline everyone is quick to place the blame on failing leadership in Rome. When the Berlin Wall came down there was a rush to suggest that John Paul II had vanquished communism all-but-singlehandedly; when AIDS ravaged Africa there was a rush to claim that the Vatican&#x2019;s line on condoms had somehow cost millions of lives. When Francis joined the fight against global warming there was a lot of implausible talk about how the papal aura would transform the difficult politics of climate; when the sex abuse scandals came to light Benedict was regularly portrayed as a spider at the center of a global criminal conspiracy.<br> <br>As with the American presidency, these expectations have encouraged an ongoing centralization: If you&#x2019;re going to be blamed for everything that goes wrong, after all, why wouldn&#x2019;t you seek more power, more control? As in American politics, neither the church&#x2019;s conservatives nor its liberals have offered consistent resistance to papal aggrandizement. Everyone wants a humbler papacy . . . right up until their man sits the papal throne.<br> <br>And as in American politics, the centralization of power has not led to its effective use. Instead, in the years of Benedict XVI especially, the sheer incompetence of the Vatican, with its warring fiefdoms and Renaissance-court intrigues and speed-of-telegraph media operations, became the one issue on which the church&#x2019;s feuding theological factions tended to wholeheartedly agree.<br> <br>ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½<br> <br>But here a certain charity is in order, because of the central dilemma facing the modern papacy&#x2014;which is that the Catholic Church has grown much larger and much weaker at more or less the same time.<br> <br>There are many more Catholics than ever before, but the church&#x2019;s influence over secular politics has ebbed almost everywhere since the 1960s, and consumer capitalism rather than the church sets the cultural agenda and shapes the moral landscape for many of those baptized millions.<br> <br>There are many more Catholics, but in the developed world they are increasingly secularized, while outside the West they&#x2019;re often just a generation or two removed from animism. With a few exceptions&#x2014;the Philippines, Poland&#x2014;the deeply inculturated, ethnically rooted Catholicism that was the norm for centuries has all but disappeared, and with it the church&#x2019;s easy, natural hold over its communicants.<br> <br>There are many more Catholics, but they often inhabit not only different political and economic systems from one another but radically different moral and metaphysical landscapes. An African Catholic participates in a religious world in which magic and witchcraft still claim cultural authority, the validity of supernatural experience is taken for granted, and the miraculous is considered almost prosaic. An American Catholic, even the most fervent, lives and works and prays in a much more skeptical and disenchanted landscape. A Middle Eastern Catholic lives in a religious landscape out of the Thirty Years War, caught in the crossfire of Islam&#x2019;s bloody civil wars. Just a plane flight away, a European Catholic subsists in a religious landscape whose self-satisfied indifference can rival Gene Roddenberry&#x2019;s Star Trek.<br> <br>There are many more Catholics . . . but on every continent and country they find themselves divided against one another, standing on different sides of a widening theological and moral gulf, arguably wider than the chasm that separated Catholicism from Orthodoxy and later from Lutheranism and Calvinism.<br> <br>That gulf exists because of Christianity&#x2019;s complicated relationship with liberal modernity, which is both a rebellious daughter of the Christian faith and a rival&#x2014;and essentially dominant&#x2014;worldview. Every major Western religion, every faith tradition, has spent decades and centuries wrestling with how far to accommodate to liberalism, and when and where to resist. The lines have been drawn over scriptural interpretation and historical criticism, over Darwin&#x2019;s theory of evolution, over church-state separation and religious liberty, over race and eugenics and human equality, over liturgical customs and traditions, over the role of women and the nature of marriage, over clothing and music and entertainment, over the importance of missionary work, over theological concepts too numerous to name, and in our own time over the sexual revolution and all its works.<br> <br>On all these issues, religious traditions that share a common theological patrimony have often ended up deeply divided. The specific controversies vary with the denomination, but there&#x2019;s an essential commonality to what separates liberal Episcopalians from conservative Anglicans, or the more liberal Evangelical Lutheran Church from the more conservative Missouri Synod Lutherans, or the liberal Alliance of Baptists from the conservative Southern Baptists, or the liberal Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) from the Presbyterian Church of America and other Calvinist formations.<br> <br>In each case disagreements over how far a faith can go accommodating itself to modernity are now the defining lines of division; those divisions have grown so deep and bitter that fellowship and communion are imperiled or broken; and liberal and conservative believers have either grown apart or gone their separate ways. And in many cases this sorting-out, this division, has been accelerated by the way globalization has brought the divergent metaphysical landscapes of America and Europe and Africa and Asia into tension with one another, hardening and accentuating the theological differences between, say, United Methodists or Episcopalians in the United States and their coreligionists in the developing world.<br> <br>The case of the American Episcopalians, and the global Anglican communion to which they belong, is particularly striking, since the entire theory of Anglicanism from the Elizabethan age onward was that it was supposed to be capacious, tolerant, a house capable of containing all sorts of contradictions, with a wing whose theology was basically evangelical and a wing that considered itself Catholic in everything save submission to the pope. Yet this capaciousness failed to contain the divisions over the sexual revolution, which were heightened by the same-sex marriage debate. Instead of holding together, both the Episcopal Church in the United States and the Anglican Church in Canada simply split, with several conservative groups going their own way and seeking support from Anglican churches overseas, particularly in Africa. (The ironies of religious history have given us a world where South Carolinian Episcopalians descended from slaveholders prefer African archbishops to white liberals.) Anglicanism&#x2019;s central authority, the archbishops of Canterbury, have attempted to paper over these divisions&#x2014;but those attempts have mostly confirmed that the worl...</p><h2>Earth God Rising: The Return of the Male Mysteries (Llewellyn&#39;s Men&#39;s Spirituality Series)</h2><p>The story of the Horned God can be heard in mythology from around the world.

A captivating tale set primarily in the American West of the 1830s, it concerns devout, individualistic members of the Religious Society of Friends (the self-styled "Peculiar People") who struggle to put their ideals into practice as they confront divisive issues of human injustice. As they respond to the plights of slaves and American Indians--even as these issues divide their church--de Hartog's characters travel on private spiritual odysseys, grappling with doubts and profound personal weaknesses. At the center of the novel is Mordecai Monk, an affluent English chocolate manufacturer who becomes a seductively eloquent and controversial evangelist, then an abnegating pilgrim witnessing among the dislocated Shawnee, next an uncertain shaman, and ultimately a Quaker martyr. Throughout, he struggles with personal demons and overpowering lust. Indiana schoolteacher Lydia Best, stripped of her position and disgraced for aiding escaped slaves, accompanies Monk among the Shawnee as they are herded west by the U.S. Cavalry. Former Philadelphians Obadiah and Charity Woodhouse undergo similar transformations as they pursue their faith. De Hartog skillfully evokes the Quaker community both regionally and internationally. This is masterful storytelling, conducted in a lively prose full of colorful details and fascinating insights into the subtleties of faith, leadership and sacrifice. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Terrible Beauty: A Lady Emily Mystery (Lady Emily Mysteries, 11)</h2><p><p><b>In this gripping new novel in the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series, Lady Emily travels to Greece where a ghost from her past returns to haunt her amid the ruins.</b></p><p>On a quest to distract her lifelong friend Jeremy from his recent heartbreak, Lady Emily organizes a holiday in Greece.

A trail of overheard conversations, murderous assailants, and dead bodies leads her on a chase to uncover more than one buried truth.</p></p><p>The daughter of two philosophy professors, I grew up surrounded by books. I was convinced from an early age that I was born in the wrong century and spent much of my childhood under the dining room table pretending it was a covered wagon. Even there, I was never without a book in hand and loved reading and history more than anything. I studied English Literature and Medieval History at the University of Notre Dame. Writing is a natural offshoot of reading, and my first novel,&nbsp;<i>And Only to Deceive</i>, was published in 2005. I'm the New York Times Bestselling author of the long-running Lady Emily Series as well as the novel&nbsp;<i>Elizabeth: The Golden Age</i>. One of the best parts of being an author is seeing your books translated, and I'm currently in love with the Japanese editions of the Emily books.&nbsp;<br><br><br>I played nomad for a long time, living in Indiana, Amsterdam, London, Wyoming, Vermont, Connecticut, and Tennessee before settling down. My husband, the brilliant British novelist&nbsp;Andrew Grant&nbsp;(I may be biased but that doesn't mean I'm wrong) and I now divide our time between Chicago and Wyoming. He makes sure I get my English characters right, and I make sure his American ones sound American."...interesting twists, a vivid setting, and engaging characters fill out a tale sure to please historical mystery lovers." -<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"Series fans will be touched to see the frequently glib Lady Emily struggle with her feelings. (Not at the expense, of course, of solving multiple mysteries and trading quips with her family and friends.) Though over a decade old, this series could still be a delightful surprise for fans of plucky Victorian heroines like Elizabeth Peters' Amelia Peabody."&nbsp;<i>-Booklist</i><br><br>"The book&nbsp;transports readers to some of the most notable sites in Greek history, brings them along on archaeological digs, exposes them to the stories of mythology and allows them to experience life in 1899. It also keeps them guessing whether Lady Emily and company will escape harm and solve the mystery of the missing artifact. Exotic locales, witty repartee and an intoxicating sense of privilege make A TERRIBLE BEAUTY a novel that's sure to please."&nbsp;<i>-Bookreporter</i><br><br>"...the newest book in Alexander's extraordinary Lady Emily series is certainly one of the very best...This is a truly fantastic story. Plot is incredible, and Lady Emily and the gang, as always, are as vivid as the Grecian world. Readers and fans of Tasha Alexander will be over the moon for this one!" -<i>Suspense Magazine&nbsp;</i></p><h2>The Great River; Art &amp; Society of the Connecticut Valley, 1635-1820.</h2><p>In 1985, the 350th anniversary of the first permanent settlement by Europeans of Connecticut and the river valley bearing that name, Hartford&#39;s Wadsworth Atheneum staged an exhibition on the &#34;Great River.&#34; It recognized that an important aspect of the historiography of New England: its cultural regions do not always coincide with its political regions. By bring various disciplines together for the first time, the Atheneum hoped to emphasize the cultural unity which characterized the region during its formative period. The exhibit and the research leading to it were the most comprehensive ever undertaken by the Museum. The exhibition represents an unusual approach to the study of the past, an approach inspired by several disciplines. The book and exhibition were conceived primarily as an effort to gain insight into the creations of Connecticut Valley&#39;s early artists, tradesmen, and mechanics. It depends on making the cultural context of these objects understood. For almost 100 years, the Connecticut Valley has been recognized as an area of regional culture by students of the arts and linguistics who have explored the overlapping distribution patterns of regional forms. The task is to explain why and for whom this regional style and aesthetics were created and by what methods they were disseminated. Approximately 370 objects were chosen from among 7,000 or more that were photographed during the course of field research preparatory to the exhibition.</p><p></p><h2>The Science of Superman</h2><p><b>YOU <i>WILL</i> BELIEVE A MAN CAN FLY! </b><br><br>He is known as the Man of Steel -- the Last Son of Krypton. For more than half a century, Superman has been an American icon and the world's first and most recognizable super hero. From his beginnings as the featured character in his own comic book, through multiple incarnations on radio, newspaper syndication, television, and the movies, Superman has emerged as the flagship hero of a publishing empire. In fact, the Man of Steel has become so ubiquitous, it's as if he were real.<br><br> But what if he <i>were</i> real? What if the Kryptonian named Kal-El, a humanoid being whose world orbited a far-off red dwarf star, was actually raised here on Earth? Would, in fact, such a being be capable of achieving the amazing feats of power commonly associated with Superman? And if so, how could his powers be scientifically explained? <br><br> In "The Science of Superman," gifted science writer <b>Mark Wolverton</b> takes up the challenge and answers these very questions. Examining Superman's powers through the lens of modern science, Wolverton explains the fundamental biological and genetic differences between Earthlings and Kryptonians that allow Superman to exercise extraordinary abilities on our planet. For the first time anywhere, you'll understand the logic and science that underlie Superman's "super powers." You'll never look at the Man of Steel the same way again.</p><p>Mark Wolverton received a B.A. in Science Writing/Journalism from DePaul University in Chicago. His fiction has appeared in <b><i>Pursuit Magazine</i></b>, <b><i>Keen Science Fiction!</i></b> and <b><i>Aboriginal Science Fiction</i></b>. He lives in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."Each chapter is concisely written, giving an overview of the super power, the science and biology behind it, then the theoretical application of this power being brought to life. True, this is not a hard-core science book but it is entertaining in such a way that it could definitely be used to coerce stubborn school kids to enjoy science. Wolverton's research is thorough, his ideas sound and his asides quite humorous." -- <i>David Maddox, sfsite.com</i></p><h2>Career Warfare: 10 Rules for Building a Successful Personal Brand and Fighting to Keep It</h2><p>The youngest CEO of John Hancock Financial Services shares his unique strategy for achieving business success, using funny stories to show readers how to make others take a chance for them, how to cultivate a great reputation, how to define and build character, and much, much more. $250,000 first printing.</p><p><p><b>"A refreshing message ... from someone who has fought many corporate wars." -- <i>The New York Times</i></b></p> <p>In <i>Career Warfare</i>, David F.

Hard work and accomplishments will only get you so far. If you intend to compete at the levels where the competition gets really ferocious&#x2014;where everybody is hard-working and accomplished&#x2014;you need a much more subtle weapon.

He also demonstrates what a battle it is to build a good one. It is a battle even to be noticed early in your career; it is a battle not to become dangerously arrogant later on.

You will also meet some of the smartest managers of their own public images on the planet and learn from the things they have done right.</p> <p>Success, says D&#x2019;Alessandro, is not going to come from your accomplishments alone.

She has acknowledged the fact that her work was shown but not sold by stating, "My image remained my own, and I am very grateful for that. I worked in peace for forty years. The production of my work had nothing to do with the selling of it." Kotik, curator of contemporary art at the Brooklyn Museum, succinctly and insightfully surveys Bourgeois' life and identifies Bourgeois' themes as "anxiety, alienation, love, identity, sex, and death." These universal obsessions inspired Bourgeois to evolve a potent lexicon of suggestive organic forms that mingle male and female, human and animal. Then, in 1982, the Museum of Modern Art mounted a retrospective of Bourgeois' distinctively feminist and even subversive work. This milestone seems to have been a catalyst for Bourgeois, who is experiencing her most intense and productive era. The vital, innovative, provocative, and psychologically sophisticated works displayed in this volume, especially the "lairs" and "cells," were all made in the last 11 years, and they are the creations of a major artist in her prime. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Trinity Blood Volume 12</h2><p>Rosenkreuz Orden, a group of vampire extremists, manipulate humans represented by the Vatican and vampires of the New Human Empire as they struggle for world domination, and to combat them, the Vatican special operations group sends a vampire who preys on the blood of other vampires.

I could hardly catch my breath after finishing a conversation with J.

A Paris-based writer for the <i>International Herald Tribune</i> in the 1940s and '50s, Buchwald wrote a column exalting, criticizing, and, most of all, poking fun at the era's celebrities. The much-loved humorist looks at the period in his life with zeal and sensitivity, capturing the excitement of the time, while reflecting on the natural ebb and flow of his life with wife Ann.CHWALD DOES IT AGAIN. . . .

This book uses language that is accessible to the lay person, but in a comprehensive way that will be useful for any professional working in women&#39;s health issues: health care professionals, counsellors, policy makers, teachers, government officials.

She is known for her compelling women-in-jeopardy stories. Her novels have received strong review attention and her third MIRA title SECRET SINS, was nominated for a RITA award by RWA. DEAD RINGER was published in May 2003.Art gallery curator and former supermodel Melody Beecham, the daughter of an aristocratic English mother and a millionaire father, has led a blessed life, but all that changes the day her mother, Rosalind, dies under dubious circumstances. In Rosalind's will, she informs her daughter that Wallis Beecham is not her actual father. Shortly thereafter, Wallis denounces Melody. With retribution in mind, Melody begins investigating Wallis's involvement in the possibly sinister Bonita partnership, led by clues from her mother's files. Melody's transformation from curator to amateur spy is unlikely, as is her eventual alliance with a covert government agency known as Unit One, which intends to use her as bait to trap Wallis. In Cresswell's descriptions of Unit One and their clever gadgetry, Cresswell satisfies readers' cravings for high espionage and macho men who stay cool under fire, but she fails to tie off major plot threads involving Melody's search for her father's identity and her budding romance with Unit One Chief of Operations Nick Anwar. Cresswell throws in a few unexpected plot twists, but not so many that readers won't notice the story's loss of momentum or its disappointing conclusion. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now Miss Hepburn breaks her long-kept silence about her private life in this absorbing and provocative memoir.<br><br>A NEW YORK TIMES Notable Book of the Year<br><br>A Book-of-the-Month-Club Main Selection</p><p><b>Katharine Hepburn</b>&nbsp;(1907&#x2013;2003) is considered to be one of the greatest actresses in Hollywood history.&nbsp;Over the course of her six-decade career, she won a total of four Academy Awards for Best Actress.YA-- Katherine Hepburn is, at 84, still the positive, feisty, upper-class lady she portrayed in The Philadelphia Story . Her autobiography, clearly not ghostwritten, tells some stories of her life but not all--she comes from a class that didn't let it all hang out. Her 27-year affair with Spencer Tracy is discussed with fond memories (the years together were to her ``absolute bliss'')--the idea that it was scandalous at the time doesn't seem to cross her mind, and she is surprised to find that Tracy's wife thought the affair was only a rumor. She seems to remember almost everyone fondly--her wonderful parents; her loving, supportive husband, whom she admits she treated badly; the numerous beaus, directors, and fellow actors with whom she worked. More than 160 black-and-white photos lend credibility to her enduring beauty, but it's the somewhat breathless, positive prose that makes Hepburn come alive as herself or as she wishes to be seen--an uncomplaining, stalwart, lucky, admired, and ``classy'' lady. --Diana C.

Within its mechanized forces, the Soviets accomplished something that their American counterparts never could - the fielding of a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun (SPAAG) that could keep pace with its heavy armored formations. <br><br>This book examines the design, development and operational history of the Soviet Union's Cold War SPAAGs: the ZSU-37, ZSU-57-2, the infamous ZSU-23-4, and the 9K22 Tunguska (better known by its NATO reporting name: SA-19 "Grison"). These vehicles excelled in their air defense role, and many US Department of Defense publications were dedicated to examining how to defeat the ZSU and its radar tracking system. These formidable weapons were encountered again in Iraq during Operation <i>Desert Storm</i>, and had equipped Russian forces in Afghanistan, cementing their place in the landscape of modern warfare. <br><br>This study explores the full history of the SPAAGs with revealing photographs, technical illustrations and detailed analysis.</p><p>Mike Guardia is a professional author and veteran of the United States Army.

He would read a little, take notes, eat regular meals and gaze contentedly out of windows. The reality, of course, was very different. In fact, Theroux experienced a decidedly odd and unexpected trip to China that set the challenging tone for his epic year-long rail journey around that vast, inscrutable land - a journey which involved riding nearly every train in the country. &#39;Wry, humorful and occasionally querulous...as Theroux makes excruciatingly clear, travelling alone in the Middle Kingdom is not for the faint of heart or stomach&#39; - &#34;Time&#34;.</p><p>Paul Theroux has written many works of fiction and travel writing, including the modern classics The Great Railway Bazaar, The Old Patagonian Express, My Secret History and The Mosquito Coast.

On the minus side, both the running copy and the caption copy will likely be too pedestrian for all but the greenest interior designers (professionals or hobbyists), and regardless of the "style" they represent, the interiors shown here suffer almost uniformly from a kind of excess and overkill, almost as if they're meant to be, if not parodies, then broad-stroke pop approximations of their respective genres. Moreover, everything seems to be copping a bit from looks that were hot at least three years before the book was published. Many of the "lush" or "romantic" spreads call to mind a Versace photo shoot circa 1988, while the "rustic" and "minimal" spreads quote two of the big decorating fads of the mid-90s--Shabby Chic and Terence Conran. There is one near-perfect composition, though: flip to pages 174-75 to view a midcentury-modern drawing room so palely elegant it nearly justifies purchase of the rest of the book, especially if you're new to the trade or game of interior design. <i>--Timothy Murphy</i>Suzanne Woloszynska is a writer and stylist from England who has written several books on interior design.

Kennan</strong></p> This book forms the second volume of Tucker's biography of Stalin, the first volume of which was "Stalin as Revolutionary". The author shows that Stalin was a Bolshevik of the radical right whose revolution cast the country deep into its imperial, autocratic past. In 1929 Stalin plunged Soviet Russia into a coercive "revolution from above", a decade-long effort to amass military-industrial power for a new war. He forced 25 million peasant families into state-run collectives and transformed the Communist Party into a servile instrument. In 1939, he concluded the pact with Hitler that enabled him to grasp at Eastern Europe while Hitler made war in the West. Tucker brings a fresh analysis to these events and to the Terror of the 1930s, revealing the motives and methods of what he calls the greatest murder mystery of this century.</p><p>Robert C. Tucker is professor of politics emeritus at Princeton University and past president of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies.&#x201c;Anyone who does not read <em>Stalin in Power</em> from cover to cover will miss the opportunity of gaining real insight into the forces that shaped the Soviet Union. This is the best book about Stalin that has ever been written and one that is not likely to be superseded in the foreseeable future.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>W. Bruce Lincoln, <em>Chicago Tribune</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Tucker writes psychobiography with tact and common sense, never letting Freud get out of hand, while his narrative holds the reader in grim fascination.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jane A. Taubman, <em>Los Angeles Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Tucker's portrait is persuasive, not least because it offers a psychological explanation for Stalin's relentless persecution of his Bolshevik comrades as well as for the bizarre rituals of the Moscow show trials, in which he forced the revolution's leaders to confess to absurd crimes.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Economist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Tucker has hunted out the sources, and he has discovered and developed a great deal more than has been generally known. . . . An extremely valuable contribution to our knowledge.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robert Conquest, <em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Tucker's contribution is to document how Stalin became a 'revolutionary of the radical right' by consciously turning to history, not to Communist ideology, for his model of the state as the agent of change. . . . This is history as it should be written: compelling narrative, intriguing detail, bold thesis.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jane E.

THE CLAYBORNES ARE BACK? AND LOVE IS IN BLOOM! First introduced in Julie Garwood&#39;s magnificent New York Times bestseller For the Rcses, which inspired the Hallmark Hall of Fame television film Rose Hill, the Clayborne brothers of Blue Belle, Montana, have been embraced by millions worldwide. Now Julie Garwood spins the individual stories of these three spirited brothers -- once a mismatched gang of street urchins -- in a trio of special novels that begins with One Pink Rose. Travis Clayborne may be the youngest of the Clayborne brothers, but he&#39;s most definitely his own man. Unless it means saying no to his beloved Mama Rose. And that&#39;s why Travis is escorting young Bostonian Emily Finnegan to Golden Crest, Montana -- where she&#39;ll discover what awaits her as a mail-order bride. Emily has made it perfectly clear that she&#39;s taken charge of her destiny and nothing is going to interfere. Falling in love with the perfect stranger isn&#39;t part of her plan, but the journey with Travis across this beautiful, rugged land opens her eyes...and her heart. Perhaps her destiny isn&#39;t exactly as she imagined.</p><p>Part one of Julie Garwood's trilogy, The Clayborne Brides, takes on a timeworn scenario: Travis Clayborne, a no-nonsense cowboy escorts a mail-order bride across Montana as a favor to his mother. The bride, Emily Finnegan, is a pedantic Boston screwball who initiates their relationship by shooting at him. She misses, and things go downhill from there. As the pair proceeds toward Emily's rendezvous with matrimony, the sparks--romantic and otherwise--fly. There are the inevitable bumps along the way, and few surprises, so don't expect any. <i>One Pink Rose</i> is like silk: smooth, lightweight, and an indulgent pleasure. The other Clayborne brothers, first introduced as a gang of New York City street urchins in Garwood's bestselling <i>For the Roses</i>, meet their matches in <i>One White Rose</i> and <i>One Red Rose</i>.Based on characters from Garwood&#39;s best-selling For the Roses (Pocket, 1995), this short romance takes headstrong, antimarriage Travis Clayborne, puts him in charge of safely transporting mail-order bride Emily Finnegan to her future husband, and lets proximity takes its course. Travis is determined to keep his promise to Mama Rose?and by the journey&#39;s end, he is glad he did. Despite a fast pace, occasional flashes of Garwood&#39;s trademark humor, a nice prolog, and the intriguing secondary character One-Eyed Jack, the story is hampered by incomplete character development and a silly heroine. Readers looking for something comparable to Garwood&#39;s more substantive works (e.g., Saving Grace, Pocket, 1993) may be disappointed. Nevertheless, this is the first of three novellas that will focus on the Clayborne brothers and their romantic adventures. Garwood lives in Kansas.

John Kenneth Turner&#x2014;a crusading California newspaperman&#x2014;presents these causes with brilliance and passion in Barbarous Mexico, his exposï¿½ of the Dï¿½az regime. Published serially beginning in the fall of 1909, his articles received scores of favorable reviews. The Rochester Times wrote: "The abolitionists in our own ante bellum days did not formulate an indictment as repulsive as that brought against Mexico by this impassioned writer." A British periodical called Turner "an American humanitarian who deserves the thanks of civilisation." Mexican President Francisco I. Madero himself said that Barbarous Mexico contributed greatly to the success of the Revolution.</p> <p>Despite its fame early in the twentieth century, Barbarous Mexico was out of print for close to sixty years.

Schreiber analyzes an &#x2018;aesthetics of disappearance&#x2019; in which the absence of visual representations of the migrants themselves shifts the focus to the tactics of state police power. At the same time migrants revise and combine documentary conventions with an aesthetics associated with &#x2018;amateur&#x2019; media in order to center their views and criticize the state.

The popular folk song, written by the late Goodman, gets a dynamic, nostalgic treatment. The haunting lyrics re-create a time some 50 years ago when people traveled by train--from Chicago through Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi to New Orleans. McCurdy uses scratchboard-and-watercolor illustrations to bring the lyrics to life, and while the pictures sometimes follow the text too literally, they certainly will have children looking closely. They show the train ride inside and out: the landscape, riddled with junked cars or growing grain; the passengers playing cards in the club car; the engineers and the Pullman porters. McCurdy's overhead perspectives, as the train speeds down the track, are among the most effective. For the many children who have never ridden the train, this captures both the boredom and the exciting difference from everyday life that occurs on a long-distance ride. A useful map introduces the text, but there's no music, a missing piece of an otherwise well-designed package. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Thielemann retraces his journey around the world with Wagner&#x2015;from Berlin to Bayreuth via Venice, Hamburg, and Chicago&#x2015;and combines his analysis with revealing insights drawn from his many years of experience as a Wagner conductor.</p><p>Thielemann discusses each of Wagner's operas in turn, and his appraisal is illuminated by a deep affinity for the music, an intimate knowledge of the scores, and the inside perspective of a world-class practitioner. And yet for all the adulation Wagner's art inspires, Thielemann does not shy away from unpalatable truths about the man himself, explaining why today Wagner is venerated and reviled in equal measure.<em>My Life with Wagner</em> is a richly rewarding read for admirers of a composer who continues to fascinate long after his death.</p></p><p><p><strong>Christian Thielemann</strong> has been the conductor of the Deutsche Oper, the Munich Philharmonic, and isthe current artistic director of the Salzburg Easter Festival. He is a regular guest of the Vienna and Berlin Philharmonics, as well as the Metropolitan Opera and has received an honorary appointment to the Royal Academy of Music in London.

Before fleeing the city, Pompey exacts a terrible bargain from the finder of secrets-to unearth the killer, or sacrifice his own son-in-law to service in Pompey's legions, and certain death. Amid the city's sordid underbelly, Gordianus learns that the murdered man was a dangerous spy. Now, as he follows a trail of intrigue, betrayal, and ferocious battles on land and sea, the Finder is caught between the chaos of war and the terrible truth he must finally reveal.<br></p><p>Steven Saylor's seventh installment in his Roma Sub Rosa series begins with a character saying, "Pompey will be mightily pissed." Scholars might argue that there is no evidence of this particular synonym for anger ever being used in 49 B.C., but the author would no doubt respond that poetic license includes doing whatever it takes to bridge the gap for modern audiences. And indeed, the head of the Roman Senate <i>is</i> mightily pissed. Rome is on the verge of another civil war, and the forces of Julius Caesar and Mark Antony have crossed the Rubicon River and are marching toward the capital. To top it all off, one of Pompey's favorite cousins has been garroted to death.<p> Before Pompey flees the city, he asks Rome's greatest detective, Gordianus the Finder, to solve the murder. But Pompey has reason to distrust Gordianus, who may have an allegiance with Caesar. To force his loyalty, Pompey seizes the detective's son-in-law, and makes him join his household army. By doing so, he ensures that Gordianus's involvement in the coming conflict will be a very personal one. Confused and troubled, Gordianus walks through Rome toward the house of his former friend and mentor, the poet Cicero. "All around me, I felt the uneasiness of the city, like a sleeper in the throes of a nightmare." Awakening from the nightmare, surviving the chaos, and solving this whodunit will be the Finder's toughest battle yet. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>Steven Saylor is the author of eight books in the Roma Sub Rosa series featuring Gordianus the Finder.

What she didn't realize that day was that something was growing inside her&#x2014;a fierce determination that would propel her to become the first black woman to receive an MBA from Harvard, then found her own multimillion-dollar business. In The Road to Someplace Better, Lillian Lincoln Lambert shares an inspiring personal saga that took her from the farm to dead-end jobs in New York City and Washington, D.C., to the ivory tower and the world of entrepreneurship.</p><p>Charting her own uncertain course, she married three times, raised two daughters, fought her way through a thorny political and social landscape for blacks and women, did her best to reshape corporate America to fit the needs of real people, testified before Congress on behalf of women business owners, fell in love with&#x2014;of all things&#x2014;golf, and built her own pure golden network of family, friends, mentors, and business contacts. How did a young black woman from 1940s America make such a leap, and what is her advice to others? </p><p>Lambert drew wisdom and ideas from everywhere, starting with her inimitable mother, Arnetha B. Hobson, herself a trailblazer who received a college degree in the 1920s, taught school, and instilled a respect for education and reading in her daughter. She also looked to her father, who, although he had only a third-grade education, supported seven children and proudly bragged that his daughter was attending the "same school that President Kennedy went to." But it was her mentor at Howard University, Professor H. Naylor Fitzhugh, who convinced her that she was Harvard material and deserved to go to its business school.</p><p>Lambert shows you the chilly world of Harvard in 1967&#x2014;all the colder if you were in the business school and black and female and, as she discovered one day, unprepared for class. It was colder still the day after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated and his death was not even mentioned in her section at the business school. She also offers you a B-school-worthy look at the nuts and bolts of running her own business, from landing big contracts to hiring the best people to watching the books like a hawk and, finally, choosing to sell.</p><p>The Road to Someplace Better is infused with Lambert's hard-won wisdom and clear-eyed advice. Rule number one: There is no substitute for education and there are no shortcuts. Discover the rest of this amazing woman's story and secrets inside. It just may change your life.</p>"This moving memoir captures the journey of a woman who came of age as America struggled to deliver on its vision of racial and gender equality. It is a great American story that shows the struggle and triumph of the generation of educated African Americans who created the reality that with opportunity and preparation all things are possible. This book is must reading for men and women who seek inspiration and the enduring lessons of succeeding against the odds."<br>&#x2014;<b>David A. Thomas</b>, H. Naylor Fitzhugh Professor of Business Administration, Harvard Business School; author of <i>Breaking Through: The Making of Minority Executives in Corporate America</i><p>"Not only did Lillian become the first black woman to receive a Harvard MBA, but she also played an instrumental role while she was a student to help the business school change its recruitment practices to increase the black student population. Harvard Business School has never been the same since 1969, and neither has Lillian. Told in a frank, thoughtful voice, Lillian's story exemplifies the transformative power of the human spirit when it sets its sights high and refuses to give up."<br>&#x2014;<b>Dorothy I. Height</b>, Chair and President Emerita, National Council of Negro Women, Inc.</p><p>"This coming-of-age story illustrates the fundamental principles of a classic education.

Her story will inspire you, lift you up, and send you on your way into a world of possibilities."<br>&#x2014;<b>Julianne Malveaux</b>, President of Bennett College for Women</p><p>"I frequently counsel young women to seize opportunities that don't exist.

It reveals with great insight how she reached her goals with her self-respect intact, as well as her view of what a better world should be.

Follow the lives of women and men who, branded by their experiences, seek to change the future in very different ways.</p><p>Jessica Shaver Renshaw has written extensively on multiple aspects of abortion for major metropolitan newspapers and Christian magazines over the past 40 years. Her biography of Gianna Jessen, &#34;Gianna: Aborted and Lived to Tell About It&#34; (Focus on the Family Publishing, 1995, 2005) is the best-selling true story of one of the rare but legal late-term abortions which results in a live birth. She considers &#34;Compelling Interests&#34; a sequel to &#34;Gianna.&#34; It presents not just one person, one family, but a nation full of people branded by their experiences with abortion. Jessica researched the history of abortion in the United States from the 1940s through the Roe vs. Wade ruling legalizing abortion through all 9 months of pregnancy--into a possible future. Although some individuals and details had to come from Jessica&#39;s imagination everything and everyone in this book really happened or is congruent with what really happened.</p><h2>The Portable Mark Twain</h2><p>Satirist, novelist, and keen observer of the American scene, Mark Twain remains one of the world&#39;s best-loved writers. This delightful collection of Twain&#39;s favorite and most memorable writings includes selected tales and sketches such as The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, How I Edited an Agricultural Journal Once, Jim Baker&#39;s Blue-Jay Yarn, and A True Story. It also features excerpts from his novels and travel books (including Roughing It, The Innocents Abroad, and Life on the Mississippi, among others; autobiographical and polemical writings; as well as selected letters and speeches. The collection also reprints the complete text of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, including the often omitted raftsmen passage.</p><p><strong>Mark Twain</strong> was born Samuel Langhorne Clemens in Florida, Missouri, in 1835, and died at Redding, Connecticut in 1910. In his person and in his pursuits he was a man of extraordinary contrasts. Although he left school at twelve when his father died, he was eventually awarded honorary degrees from Yale University, the University of Missouri, and Oxford University. His career encompassed such varied occupations as printer, Mississippi riverboat pilot, journalist, travel writer, and publisher. He made fortunes from his writing but toward the end of his life he had to resort to lecture tours to pay his debts. He was hot-tempered, profane, and sentimental<b></b>and also pessimistic, cynical, and tortured by self-doubt. His nostalgia helped produce some of his best books.

From August 1940 to May 1941, the island nation was subjected to a relentless campaign of aerial bombing. German night raids gutted towns and cities, rendering thousands homeless (250,000 Londoners were homeless by October 1940 alone), killing 43,500 civilians and wounding 139,000 more.<br><br> That the Blitz did not bring the UK to its knees is due, in large part, to a vast response by Civil Defence services and the British people themselves. Preparations for enduring a strategic bombing campaign began in the mid-1930s with the development of the Air Raid Precautions (ARP) organisation, and by late 1938 more than 700,000 people were serving in ARP roles. During the war itself, some 1.5 million people took up duties in the Civil Defence (General) services, in roles ranging from air raid wardens to ambulance drivers to heavy rescue parties.</p><p><p><b>Chris McNa</b>b&nbsp;specializes in military history and military technology.

A refreshing modernist aesthetic imbued with subtle references to history and culture defines their work. While Marty and Fournier are best known for their minimalist villas set in awe-inspiring landscapes, recent commissions also include restaurants, boutiques, and hotels across New York, Paris, and London.&nbsp;<br><br> The first monograph dedicated to Studio KO, this beautifully illustrated book spotlights a diverse array of their work, from private residences in breathtaking scenery, ranging from the Moroccan mountains to Provence and Brittany in France, to the highly anticipated Yves Saint Laurent Museum, due to open in Marrakech in 2017. Boasting never-before-seen architectural plans, personal photos, and sumptuous photographs of finished spaces, this book offers a fascinating look at the most in-demand architectural designers of today.</p><p><b>Karl Fournier&nbsp;</b>and&nbsp;<b>Olivier Marty</b>&nbsp;founded Studio KO in&nbsp;2000&nbsp;after graduating with architecture degrees from Paris&#x2019;s ï¿½cole des Beaux-Arts.&nbsp;<b>Tom Delavan</b>&nbsp;is a specialist in decorative arts, an artistic director,&nbsp;and interior&nbsp;designer, and is the design editor at the&nbsp;<i>New York Times&#x2019;</i>&nbsp;<i>T Magazine</i>. <b>Pierre Bergï¿½&nbsp;</b>was a renowned French businessman and philanthropist who aided his companion, Yves Saint Laurent, in founding and developing his namesake haute couture house.&nbsp;"The book, whose large-format photographs bear first-hand witness to the firm&#x2019;s singular ability to create a modern style that feels both sumptuous and minimalist, launches October 11, just in advance of the museum's opening, later this month. <b>A particularly special part of the book is its sweeping look into&nbsp;Studio KO&#x2019;s residential oeuvre, a collection of materially sophisticated homes nestled into idyllic landscapes around the world</b>."<br>&#x2014;<i>Architectural Digest</i><br><br>"A feast for the eyes, this captivating volume is certainly a must-have for any design library, but will also be truly enjoyed by architects who genuinely value larger questions about living a meaningful life"<br>&#x2014;<i>Identity</i><br><br>"One reason for Studio KO&#x2019;s growing fame is their interiors, for everything from luxury apartments to hotels, such as Andre&#x301; Balazs&#x2019;s fantastically buzzy Chiltern Firehouse in London.

"<br>&#x2014;<i>Departures</i></p><h2>The Visual Dictionary of American Domestic Architecture</h2><p><br><br>Architectural historian Rachel Carley offers a richly detailed guide to 500 years of American home design. More than 600 precisely detailed illustrations show readers how to identify and describe a house of a particular style. Every element that may be found on a Beaux Arts townhouse, a Navajo hogan, or a Craftsman bungalow is displayed. An essential reference for American homeowners, restorers, and old-house buffs who, by the year 2000, will spend more on home renovation and restoration than on new-home construction.<br><br></p><p>This collection of detailed black-and-white drawings of houses and other domestic buildings (barns, garages, gazebos) is presented in 12 chapters arranged chronologically, from Native American dwellings to contemporary trends. Each chapter is introduced by one page of text, and additional comments accompany the illustrations. Each drawing is labeled with the names of various architectural details.<p>Several examples are provided for each time period. For example, seven drawings reflect Federal-style homes in the chapter on neoclassical styles. The section on prefab housing in the postwar chapter includes traditional kit structures as well as Quonset huts and mobile homes. Some drawings highlight special interior or exterior features: fireplaces, staircases, gates, and so on. A series of inserts called "anatomies" look at basic construction methods: trusses, double-hung sashes, log notching. Floor plans are often provided. One helpful feature is that common usage is included in parenthesis next to technical terms that accompany illustrations; for example, split-wood shingles are also defined as <i>shakes</i>, a thatched sun shelter is also identified as a <i>ramada</i>.</p><p>Intended for architecture students and design professionals, this book could also be used as a resource for secondary school American history units. The first chapter covers Native American dwellings such as Algonquin wigwams, Apache wikiups, Navaho hogans, and Tlingit plank houses, and chapter 8 deals with folk and frontier houses. The index includes all the terms used as labels.</p><p>A better choice for public and school collections is the <i>Eyewitness Visual Dictionary of Buildings</i> (Dorling Kindersley, 1992), which uses photographs as well as illustrations and spans all sorts of structures from ancient through modern times. Other visual dictionaries, such as the <i>Macmillan Visual Desk Reference</i> (1993) and <i>What's What: A Visual Glossary of the Physical World</i> (Hammond, 1981), also include sections on architecture that satisfy many browsing and general reference needs. However, as a specialized resource, Carley's unique graphic guide will be a welcome addition to architecture and design collections. <i></i></p>This attractive dictionary presents the details and styles of residential architecture in the United States through over 500 annotated drawings. Skibinski and Lam base these examples on magazine illustrations and measured drawings from the Historic American Buildings Survey. Particularly useful are the clearly delineated illustrations that focus on construction technology (the anatomy of a double-hung sash and a balloon frame building, for example). Carley's (The Backyard Book, LJ 5/1/88) text would have benefited from a more expansive discussion of regional variations in style and specific information with which to date buildings. While the most useful book of this type remains Virginia and Lee McAlester's Field Guide to American Houses (LJ 8/84), this dictionary, designed for use by homeowners and curious tourists, is a welcome addition to the field.

Little wonder, then, that their first volume of BRM - the Saga of British Racing Motors was hailed as the most detailed and authoritative history of a grand prix team ever published. It covered the birth of BRM, and took readers through the years of the troublesome V16 cars and the 4-cylinder 2.5-litre models of the 1950s.Now, Volume 2 of their four-volume BRM history takes the story forward into the V8 era with the last of the cars built around a tubular chassis. It covers the most successful period in the Formula 1 team&#39;s career, including the World Championship won with Graham Hill in 1962, the first two of his five wins at Monaco and the first two of his three victories in the US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen.Having unique access to the BRM company files, the authors have been able to delve deeply into the emotion-charged background to the BRM team&#39;s final emergence as a Grand Prix front runner, to their involvement in the Tasman races in Australasia and to their first foray at Le Mans with the Rover-BRM gas turbine cars.As with Volume 1, the print run of this and succeeding volumes is being restricted to 2500 numbered copies. Volume 3, to be published late-2003, will concentrate on the V8-powered monocoque cars from 1964 to 1968, leaving the final volume, to be published in 2004, to conclude the saga of BRM with the H16 and V12 cars from 1968 to 1978.* Please note: As Volume 1 is out of print, the publishers will be commissioning a short reprint of unnumbered copies later in 2003 to enable new subscribers to complete their four-volume set.</p><p><p>Doug Nye is widely acknowledged as the world's foremost authority on classic and historic international motor racing. His expertise is widely sought by car owners, restorers and racers and his accuracy and attention to detail is renowned throughout the book publishing world. BRM has always been his particular passion, and his three volumes on the marque (with a fourth and final volume to come) have set a standard of unrivalled comprehensiveness which have earned him many accolades and awards.</p><p><b>Hot4s.com.au (</b><b>Australia</b><b>), </b><b>M</b><b>ay 2007</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Yes, you did read right.&nbsp;The cost&nbsp;on this puppy is $74.95, but it's quite a special book for those in the know. You see, it details the rise and subsequent fall of the great British Racing Motors, which was something of an emotional roller-coaster for Pommie pride throughout the '50s and '60s. The sheer research that must have gone into this thing, not to mention trying to pull all these photos from archives and what have you, must have been absolutely astronomical, and if you're a fan of British motor-racing history, you'll no doubt turn every page with either a tear in your eye or a hand on your heart.<br><br> If you can stomach the price, it's well worth the effort.</p></p><h2>Hitler&#39;s Willing Executioners - Ordinary Germans And The Holocaust</h2><p>A work of the utmost importance--as authoritative as it is explosive--Hitler&#39;s Willing Executioners will fundamentally change our perception of the Holocaust and of Germany in the Nazi period. Goldhagen reaches conclusions that are both uncompromising and savage, rejecting as inadequate the conventional historical explanations for how an entire country could allow the Holocaust to happen, and gives the first detailed, broad-ranging account of the actual killers of the Jews. 31 photos.</p><p>In a work that is as authoritative as it is explosive, Goldhagen forces us to revisit and reconsider our understanding of the Holocaust and its perpetrators, demanding a fundamental revision in our thinking of the years between 1933-1945. Drawing principally on materials either unexplored or neglected by previous scholars, Goldhagen marshals new, disquieting primary evidence that explains why, when Hitler conceived of the &#34;final solution&#34; he was able to enlist vast numbers of willing Germans to carry it out. A book sure to provoke new discussion and intense debate.<p>&nbsp;<br>Daniel Jonah Goldhagen is an Associate of Harvard University's Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies.&nbsp; His doctoral dissertation, which is the basis for the book, was awarded the American Political Science Association's 1994 Gabriel A. Almond Award for the best dissertation in the field of comparative politics.&nbsp; After publication of this book in Germany, in 1997 Daniel Johan Goldhagen won the highly prestigious Democracy Prize.&nbsp; He is the author of <i>A Moral Reckoning: The Role of the Catholic Church in the Holocaust and Its Unfulfilled Duty of Repair</i>.</p><br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Cow Moo Me</h2><p>For babies beginning to respond to rhythm, this silly rhyming verse is a perfect read-aloud.</p><p>This is Stephen Losordo's first book for children.

Unlike most studies, which assume that the "rise of the West" is the story of the coming of the modern world, this history, drawing upon new scholarship on Asia, Africa, and the New World, constructs a story in which those parts of the world play major roles. Robert B. Marks defines the modern world as one marked by industry, the nation state, interstate warfare, a large and growing gap between the wealthiest and poorest parts of the world, and an escape from "the biological old regime." He explains its origins by emphasizing contingencies (such as the conquest of the New World); the broad comparability of the most advanced regions in China, India, and Europe; the reasons why England was able to escape from common ecological constraints facing all of those regions by the 18th century; and a conjuncture of human and natural forces that solidified a gap between the industrialized and non-industrialized parts of the world.<br><br>View an online study guide for this book.</p><p><b>Robert B.

Bacon)<br><br>This is a concise and thought-provoking treatment of some major themes in world history: state-building, industrialization, environmental change, and the transformation of material life. The treatment of global inequality as a phenomenon in its own right&#x2014;not just as a residue of more 'development' having occurred in some places than others&#x2014;gives the book an important additional dimension. And as a single-authored work, it has a consistent and engaging voice that is hard to find in standard textbooks. (Pomeranz, Kenneth L.)<br><br>An absorbing, crisp, and compact account of how the modern world got to be the way it is. This is the most accessible and comprehensive book yet written that takes into account the recent departures in world history scholarship.

McNeill)<br><br>Splendid--fresh, forceful, and efficient. Marks has a clear focus on the Eurocentrism of most of the textbooks on world history and he has developed an effective, solidly grounded strategy to counter the problem.

Flynn)<br><br>Marks convincingly discredits the standard Eurocentric narrative of mainstream historians, replacing it with a balanced story that places Asia at the centre prior to the 1800s and Europe (then, America) at the centre thereafter....[The author uses] a cogent, accessible style grounded in key historical concepts such as contingency, conjuncture, and accident.

Custody of the popular memory of a figure like More is of some real importance, and Marius&#39;s custody is exemplary. His book is accessible enough to be read by a wide audience but complete and original enough to merit reading by a specialized audience. It is as subtle and satisfying a portrait as I have encountered in years.-Jack Miles, Los Angeles Times Book ReviewRichard Marius was a historian, novelist, playwright, and a member of the Harvard faculty.</p><h2>The Cutters</h2><p>All unhappy families are alike, to invert Tolstoy, but each happy family is happy in its own way. Although they live in a rambling white house in a midwestern town called Meadows, the Cutters are too irreducibly real to stand in for the average all-American family created by pollsters, popular magazines, and television sitcoms.<p>They compete for the reader's attention, pursuing happiness in human ways that have not changed since 1926, when <i>The Cutters</i> was first published. But it is Nell Cutter who best illustrates Bess Streeter Aldrich's strength in drawing memorable characters. Whether she is decorating the house on a budget for wealthy guests or testing child-raising theories or trying to make the daily loaf a little more yeasty, Nell Cutter is not afraid to ex-periment. She may go out on a limb, but it is seldom a dead one.</p></p><p>Bess Streeter Aldrich (1881-1954) became one of America&#39;s best-loved and most widely read writers in the first half of the twentieth century. &#34;A Lantern in Her Hand,&#34; her most famous novel, has remained a favorite since 1928; it is also available in a Bison Books edition."<i>The Cutters</i> is well conceived and written.

As this fundamental reproductive right continues to be stigmatized and jeopardized, over sixty artists and writers have created comics that boldly share their own experiences, and educate readers on the history of abortion, current political struggles, activism, and more. Lawyers, activists, medical professionals, historians, and abortion fund volunteers have teamed up with cartoonists and illustrators to share their knowledge in accessible comics form.<br><i>Comics for Choice</i> contains comics from exciting cartoonists like <b>Sophia Foster-Dimino</b> (<i>Sex Fantasy</i>), <b>Leah Hayes</b> (<i>Not Funny Ha-Ha</i>), <b>Anna Bongiovanni</b> (<i>Grease Bats</i>), <b>Jennifer Camper</b> (<i>Rude Girls and Dangerous Women</i>), <b>Ally Shwed</b> (<i>Sex Bomb Strikes Again</i>) and <b>Kat Fajardo</b> (<i>Gringa!</i>, <i>La Raza Anthology</i>), and reproductive justice scholars like <b>Rickie Solinger</b>, (<i>Reproductive Politics: What Everyone Needs to Know</i>) <b>Renee Bracey Sherman</b> (Program Director, We Testify), and <b>Dr. Cynthia Greenlee<b> (Senior Editor, <i>Rewire</i>).</b></b></p><p>Spurred by the 2016 election, editors Newlevant, Taylor, and Fox produced this deeply thoughtful, inclusive anthology of abortion stories that showcases the talents of more than 50 writers and artists, diverse in age, location, race, gender, experience, and more. Each entry offers something unique, and together they capture a nuanced understanding of abortion&#x2014;the anxieties, fears, unexpected humors, and comforts&#x2014;that is often lost in popular discourse. Teens will learn about trailblazers such as Dorothy Brown in Cynthia Greenlee and Jaz Malone's "They Call Her Dr. D: Tennessee's First Black Woman Legislator and Abortion Reform." The comics are unflinching in their portrayal of the external and internal pressures that weigh on an individual before or after going through this process. The black-and-white artwork shines in its originality and style: Stephanie Rodriguez's humorous but oh-so-relatable facial expressions in Daniela Diaz's "MundoFerpecto."

Greeley. Ostensibly &#x201c;Blackie&#x201d; is in the historic city of Seville to attend a conference on American philosophy, but a far more critical assignment also requires his attention. The local cardinal has summoned the wily archbishop to Spain in hopes that Blackie can avert a murder before it happens.<br><br>The threat of violence hangs ominously over the regal palace of a family of wealthy Spanish aristocrats. Dona Teresa, a pious widow whose exotic beauty unsettles even Blackie, finds herself beset by avaricious relatives determined to control her life and fortune. A tangled web of obligations, traditions, and frustrated sexual desires binds the family together even as they bitterly contend against one another. With three generations of passionate nobility sharing the same roof, it seems only a matter of time before pride, greed, and lust leads to bloodshed.<br><br>But while the archbishop attempts to forestall a modern-day Spanish tragedy, dramatic events back in Chicago conspire to change his life forever. . . .<br><br><i>The Archbishop in Andalusia</i> opens an exciting new chapter in the illustrious career of one of Andrew Greeley&#x2019;s most beloved characters.</p></p><p><p>Priest, sociologist, author and journalist, Father Andrew M.

He was the author of over 50 best-selling novels and more than 100 works of non-fiction, and his writing has been translated into 12 languages.</p><p>Father Greeley was a Professor of Sociology at the University of Arizona and a Research Associate with the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago. In addition to scholarly studies and popular fiction, for many years he penned a weekly column appearing in the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> and other newspapers. He was also a frequent contributor to <i>The New York Times</i>, the <i>National Catholic Reporter</i>, <i>America </i>and <i>Commonweal</i>, and was interviewed regularly on national radio and television. He authored hundreds of articles on sociological topics, ranging from school desegregation to elder sex to politics and the environment.</p><p>Throughout his priesthood, Father Greeley unflinchingly urged his beloved Church to become more responsive to evolving concerns of Catholics everywhere. His clear writing style, consistent themes and celebrity stature made him a leading spokesperson for generations of Catholics. He chronicled his service to the Church in two autobiographies, <i>Confessions of a Parish Priest</i> and <i>Furthermore!</i></p><p>In 1986, Father Greeley established a $1 million Catholic Inner-City School Fund, providing scholarships and financial support to schools in the Chicago Archdiocese with a minority student body of more than 50 percent. In 1984, he contributed a $1 million endowment to establish a chair in Roman Catholic Studies at the University of Chicago. He also funded an annual lecture series, &#x201c;The Church in Society,&#x201d; at St. Mary of the Lake Seminary, Mundelein, Illinois, from which he received his S.T.L. in 1954.</p><p>Father Greeley received many honors and awards, including honorary degrees from the National University of Ireland at Galway, the University of Arizona and Bard College. A Chicago native, he earned his M.A. in 1961 and his Ph.D. in 1962 from the University of Chicago.</p><p>Father Greeley was a penetrating student of popular culture, deeply engaged with the world around him, and a lifelong Chicago sports fan, cheering for the Bulls, Bears and the Cubs. Born in 1928, he died in May 2013 at the age of 85.</p>Greeley's breezy 17th Blackie Ryan novel (after 2007's <i>The Bishop at the Lake</i>) takes Ryan to the south of Spain for a conference, where the local cardinal requests his help preventing the murder of a beautiful and wealthy widow, Doï¿½a Teresa Maria, duchess of Seville, whose many relatives envy her money, title and power in the community. Blackie's sister, meanwhile, has put pressure on Blackie to nudge his nephew Joseph and Joseph's girlfriend, Peggy Anne Nolan, who have accompanied him on the trip, into setting a date for their wedding. To add to his concerns, Blackie receives word from the U.S. of the ill health of his superior, the archbishop of Chicago. Armchair travelers will relish the descriptions of Seville and Cordoba, along with the details of Spanish history and customs. Indeed, some readers may feel the travelogue aspects overshadow the mystery untangling, but all will enjoy Greeley's wit and good humor. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The weather made for miserable stakeouts, although stakeouts were a part of a bounty hunter's life. The time of year only added to the chip she carried on her shoulder and reminded her of all she'd lost.</p><p> </p><p>When she was six, she and her mother had been shopping for groceries when they'd been hit by a drunk driver. It had killed her mother instantly and put Cat in the hospital for days. When she was finally dismissed, her mother's funeral was over, and she and her father were on their own.</p><p> </p><p>Over the years, she learned to adjust, and she and her father grew closer. Then, just before her thirteenth birthday, and only days before she and her father were planning to leave on vacation, a man with a tattooed face broke into their house, stabbed her father and cut her throat, leaving her unable to scream as she watched him die. </p><p> </p><p>After that, the Texas Social Services system finished the raising of Catherine Dupree, during which time she'd acquired the nickname Cat. </p><p> </p><p>Being a bounty hunter had been a job she'd thought about during those long years. What better way to find her father's killer than to work in his world? At eighteen, she'd aged out of the system, then, two months later, gone to work for a bail-bondsman named Art Ball. </p><p> </p><p>Art had been taken with the dark-haired, leggy teenager, and hired her to file and deliver papers to the courthouse, even though he hadn't needed the extra help. But, he would say later, it was the smartest thing he'd ever done. By the time she turned twenty-one, she had a black belt in Karate, was licensed to carry a firearm and had gone through several kinds of schooling to learn private investigation techniques, as well as the ins and outs of bringing home bail jumpers. </p><p> </p><p>Also during that time, she began accumulating mug shots of perps with tattoos on their faces in hopes of finding her father's killer. She'd been looking for him ever since, and often thought it strange that a man with such markings was so difficult to find. Logically, one would have assumed that a man with the equivalent of a road map on his face should stand out in any crowd. </p><p> </p><p>Every time she left to go after someone who'd jumped bail, Art would tell her to be careful. He would add to that by reminding her that she didn't have nine lives left like the cats who hung out in the alley behind the bail bond office, because she'd already used up two.</p><p> </p><p>The ensuing years and her cold-blooded determination had given her a hard-nosed and enviable reputation. The fact that she was tall and, in many men's eyes, very beautiful didn't matter to her. She'd grown up fast, with a whiskey-rough voice and a bad attitude. She had a fine set of boobs, which she didn't consider an asset. They were, however, nicely distracting to the men she went after. Most of the time they were looking elsewhere when she threw the first punch.</p><p> </p><p>Such, she was certain, was going to be the case today for bail jumper Nelson Brownlee. Following up on a tip, Cat had located Brownlee at an old apartment building in Fort Worth. Now all she had to do was take him down and bring him in. </p><p> </p><p>Nelson Brownlee was a four-time loser with a penchant for armed robbery. He'd promised himself the last time he'd been released that he was going to move back to Michigan, but Nelson had never been good at keeping promises, even to himself. All the way to the Quick Stop, he'd been thinking something didn't feel right. Still, he'd ignored his instincts, robbed the store and then gotten himself caught on his way out the door by an off-duty cop. He figured it had served him right and never dreamed he would be able to bond out. But he had. He'd taken it as a sign from God to change his ways. </p><p> </p><p>However, he and God had never been on very good speaking terms, and instead of making an appearance in court on his due date, he'd jumped bail. For the past week he'd been in hiding without money, hanging out at an old girlfriend's apartment in Fort Worth. </p><p> </p><p>He'd been here six days, and was sick and tired of the scent of boiled cabbage and bratwurst. Even the free sex from the old girlfriend was losing appeal. So when the knock sounded on the door, he ignored his better judgment and went to answer it. </p><p> </p><p>Cat's fingertips were numb from the cold, but persistence had paid off. Frostbite was a minor hazard of the job compared to the satisfaction of having a healthy bank account. Her badge was in plain sight, so there would be no mistaking her purpose when she confronted her perp. She checked for the set of handcuffs she tucked under the waistband in the back of her jeans, felt to make sure her handgun was in the holster beneath her coat, then ran her fingers along the taser in her coat pocket as she started up the stairs. Brownlee's woman had an apartment on the sixth floor, and in a building this old, an elevator did not come with the deal.</p><p> </p><p>Cat's nose wrinkled as she moved from floor to floor. The compilation of scents coming from beneath the doors was staggering. She could smell everything from a backed-up toilet to boiled cabbage--a disgusting combination. It didn't, however, deter her from her goal, which was bringing Art's bail jumper back.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn't even breathing hard when she reached the sixth floor. Her steps were sure as she strode down the hall, pausing only briefly before doubling her fist and pounding on the door of apartment 609. She re-checked the location of her gun and taser, then braced herself.</p><p> </p><p>Nelson Brownlee opened the door. "Well hell," he muttered, and tried to slam it shut. The door caught on Cat's boot as she shoved her foot in the doorway, then swung inward as she pushed her way in.</p><p> </p><p>"Now, Nelson," Cat drawled, as she grabbed him by the collar and slammed him belly first up against the wall. "That's no way to say hello. It's cold outside. The least you could do was offer me a hot cup of coffee."</p><p> </p><p>"Like hell!" Nelson yelled, and bowed himself backward, then spun and took a swing at her. </p><p> </p><p>She took a quick step sideways, dodging his fist. As she did, she came off one foot and kicked upward, landing a neat but lethal blow to his chin. He went down like a felled ox. She quickly handcuffed him, then grabbed him under the arms and was about to drag him out the door when she heard someone scream.</p><p> </p><p>She dropped Nelson's arms and ran out of the apartment. Smoke was filling the stairwell from above, drifting downward in thick deadly fingers. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, Lord," she muttered, and glanced back inside the apartment. Brownlee was still out. </p><p> </p><p>She couldn't leave without him, but he weighed a good hundred pounds more than she did. This wasn't good. She glanced down the hall again, grabbed her cell phone and quickly dialed 911. After giving the dispatcher the address of the building, she ran back to Brownlee. Already the smoke was so thick on the sixth floor that it was becoming difficult to breathe. Cat raced into the kitchen, grabbed a dish towel from the cabinet, doused it with water, then tied it around her face. The scent clinging to the towel was not enhanced by getting it wet, and sucking it up her nostrils came close to making her gag. Still, it was better to gag than burn.</p><p> </p><p>Smoke was filling the apartment as Cat ran back to the living room and pulled Nelson into the hall. His head bumped hard as she dragged him over the threshold, but it couldn't be helped. Better a headache than dying. </p><p> </p><p>"Come on, Brownlee, wake up!" Cat cried, but Brownlee wasn't talking.</p><p> </p><p>Cursing beneath her breath, she got him as far as the landing, then bent over, and with what she would later consider a burst of adrenaline spurred by an overwhelming fear, pulled him up and over her shoulder in a fireman's carry and started down the stairs, staggering slightly under the weight.</p><p> </p><p>Cat hadn't counted on the difficulty of balancing dead weight on a decline. Every time she took a step down, Brownlee's head bumped against her back, keeping her slightly off balance. But the heat behind them and the smoke swirling around their heads was all the reminder she needed to keep moving. They'd cleared the fifth floor and were just past the fourth floor landing when Cat sensed someone on the stairs in front of her. Her instincts proved right as she stepped down onto the heel of a boot. </p><p> </p><p>Staggering to keep from losing her load, she grabbed the railing with one hand and the back pocket of Brownlee's jeans with the other. </p><p> </p><p>"Move faster or get over! I'm coming through!" she yelled. </p><p> </p><p>Wilson McKay was, what the waitress at his favorite diner called, "a looker." He was four inches over six feet, with a linebacker's build. His hair style wasn't a style at all, but a buzz-cut that was always in the process of growing out. He wore one small gold hoop in his ear, and denim or leather with equal distinction. His nose had been broken twice, and there was a small scar beneath his right eye. Every scar, bump and line on his face was a testament to the hard knocks of his life. </p><p> </p><p>He had turned forty yesterday, and a bunch of his friends had thrown a big party for him down at the bar across the street from his bail bond office. The beer had been flowing freely. They'd even sprung for a day-old cake from the deli section of one of the big grocery stores across town. Their gift to Wilson had been Wanelle, the prettiest hooker on their side of the city, which was a title Wanelle held proudly, even if her claim to fame came from a real long stretch of the truth.</p><p> </p><p>Still, Wanelle had all her own teeth and clear skin, and she was almost pretty when she laughed. Wilson knew her slightly. He'd seen her around Ft. Worth from time to time, but buying a woman had never been his style. He'd felt trapped when Wanelle had been presented to him, especially since his buddies had tied a big red bow around her neck. Turning her down would have been a serious social faux pas to his friends<i> and</i> to Wanelle. So, rather than hurt everyone's feelings, Wilson had graciously accepted, and they'd spent the night in her fifth fl...</p></p><h2>Henrietta&#39;s House (Puffin Books)</h2><p>Henrietta, her family and friends, set off in traps for a birthday picnic.

Turning his back on the horrors of the twentieth century, he devoted the rest of his life to images of sexual Fantasy, which in their own way have shaped the male collective consciousness just as powerfully as the nuclear missile. His conversion coincided in with the growing liberation of US cities as they rebelled against Eisenhower to embrace a night-life of decadence, sensuality, and physical abandon. &#34;&#34;Exotique&#34;&#34; presented the pin-up as a Femme Fatale, publishing shot after shot of the dominatrix adorned with tight corset, razor heels, complex underwear and an expression on her Face that demanded obedience. Enthusiastically casting from a roster of willing models (including the legendary Betty Page) as well as call-girls and dancers, Burtman experimented with bondage scenarios and group poses, and as a bonus hired in the maestros of the illustrative arts like Eric Stanton to bring his pneumatic ideal to life even more extravagantly.

We, the authors of this, and all our guidebooks, are hikers. We personally researched and hiked all the hiking trails in our books. We took the photographs. We created the detailed maps and our colored coded system for visually defining the difficulty level of all the hiking trails. Our elevation profiles have the same color coding for steepness of gradient. We calculate the total elevation gain of the entire trail. Our innovative Hikes Chart lists all of the hikes on the first page so you can compare the scenic rating, difficulty, distance, elevation gain and important features of all the hiking trails in one place. Our directions to the trailhead are clear and concise. For some, we even include a map. We tell you what vehicle you need to get there and the condition of the road. We found such detail missing or frustrating to find in other books, so we wrote our own. Hiking Colorado is a broad topic. We chose to concentrate on hiking southwestern Colorado. For us, it offered the most extensive network of superb hiking trails in a relatively small area of Colorado. This hiking guide covers the fabulous hiking trails in and around the historic towns of Ouray, Silverton and Lake City Colorado. Ouray offers a splendid variety of early season hiking trails. Silverton offers 4 different areas of amazing high country trails. Lake City is the staging ground for five Colorado 14,000 foot peaks. So, put your boots on and go Take A Hike.

In a spectacularly illustrated volume that captures all the atmosphere of Tolstoy's Russia, Tolstoy scholar Donna Tussing Orwin carefully presents and annotates five of the writer's finest stories: "God Sees the Truth, But Waits," "How Much Land Does a Man Need?," The Empty Drum," "The Imp and the Crust," and "Three Questions." Louise and Aylmer Maude, who knew Tolstoy personally, have translated the text.<br></p><p>Gr. 8-11. Though simply told and dramatically illustrated in folklore style, the five stories in this large-size collection in the Stories for Young People series are not for young children but for older students and adults to read and discuss. Tolstoy scholar Orwin points out in her excellent introduction and biography and in her notes with each story that Tolstoy uses the clear, concrete style of Russian folktales to make readers think about how they should live their own lives. The messages are not simple; the devils and imps in the narratives stand for bad impulses. The longest story ("How Much Land Does a Man Need?") dramatizes Tolstoy's changing views about private property, while the first one ("God Sees the Truth, but Waits") is a heartbreaking drama of revenge and sorrow. From his own experience, Tolstoy also writes about the horror and allure of battle and about his opposition to organized government and religion. Lots to talk about here, and Orwin's pastel pictures in shades of orange and green show the elemental conflict. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

The demand for reprints of perennial favorites or early, hard-to-find dishes prompted Mrs. Dull to compile them into her now-famous book. Not only does it include individual recipes, but it also suggests menus for various occasions and holidays. Her famous Georgia Christmas Dinner, for instance, consists of grapefruit, roast turkey, dry stuffing, dry rice, turkey gravy, candied sweet potatoes, buttered green peas, cranberry jelly, celery hearts, hot biscuits, sweet butter, syllabub, and cake.</p><p>Mrs. Dull was one of the most sought-after caterers in Atlanta even before she began her newspaper column. Her vast, practical knowledge of food and its preparation, and her embrace of new, but never gimmicky, innovations in cooking served her readers well. Upon Mrs. Dull's death in 1964 at the age of 100, the <i>Atlanta Journal</i> said that her book was "the standard by which regional cooks have been measured since 1928." <i>Southern Cooking</i> is the starting place for anyone in search of authentic dishes done in the traditional style.</p></p><p>An iconic collection of southern home-cooking recipesS.

When the western Allies decided to launch a second front in North Africa, they carefully considered the anti-British feeling left in France by the ill-advised attack by the Royal Navy on the French Fleet at Mers el Kebir in July 1940. Consequently, the operation was given an American rather than a British complexion, General Eisenhower was chosen to lead a mostly American force into battle and the major Royal Navy contribution was kept as inconspicuous as possible. At this point in the war, the Allies had almost no experience with amphibious operations and it was a risky undertaking to carry out such an immense operation covering multiple landings over 600 miles apart. Even more amazing was the fact that part of the invasion forces was to depart from the United States, 6,000 miles away. As the orders were not confirmed until a month before Operation `Torch&#39; was launched, there was very little time to organise such a logistically complex operation involving American and British forces, and even less time for the pro-Allied French to organise more than small measures of support. There were two landings in the Mediterranean, at three main points near Algiers and three near Oran, and three landings on the Atlantic coast of Morocco. There, the main landing came ashore at Fedala, 18 miles north-east of Casablanca, and the armour was brought ashore at Safi, 140 miles south-east. In spite of all the difficulties, the landings all went well and the operation quickly achieved all of its initial objectives. However, the Germans reacted swiftly and, with little Allied interference, they rushed in reinforcements to Tunisia by air and sea. The Allies were thus drawn into a six-month campaign in Tunisia, the First Army from Operation `Torch&#39; soon joining hands with the Eighth Army advancing from Libya to finally clear Axis presence along the southern shore of the Mediterranean. This operation marked the first time that American troops fought against German forces during the Second World War. They had a rough baptism of fire in southern Tunisia in February 1943, training, equipment and leadership failed in many instances to meet the requirements of the battlefield, but the US Army was quick to learn and revise army doctrines, particularly with respect to the use of armour. The successful campaign created thousands of seasoned soldiers of all ranks whose experience would prove decisive in subsequent campaigns. The next test was only two months away - the invasion of Sicily. In addition, Operation `Torch&#39; brought the French army back into the war. Most important of all, the Allies had seized the initiative in the West.</p><p></p><h2>Mary Kelly (Phaidon Contemporary Artist Series)</h2><p>This text argues that Mary Kelly&#39;s combination of texts with images and found objects has been pivotal, not only to the development of Conceptual Art, but also to 20th-century feminism.

More than a century after her death, Louisa May Alcott's stories continue to delight readers of all ages. </p>Kindergarten-Grade 4-A picture-book adaptation of a classic holiday story that retains most of the major elements of the original, including Gram's misunderstood illness, the feigned bear attack, and the sisters' culinary foibles. While the adaptor's changes seem aimed at making the story more accessible to contemporary readers, this pared-down version unfortunately lacks the spirit of Alcott's creation. Dialogue has been edited to make it simpler and more straightforward, but much of the poetry and language of the time has been lost. Also missing are the subtle but realistic details and descriptions that create the sense of the era. Sprightly line-and-wash illustrations complement the theme of good humor and family love. The full-page spreads are framed in country patterned borders, which add to the feeling of nostalgic storytelling. Like the text, the illustrations are adequate, but lack richness and character. Michael McCurdy's version (Holiday, 1989) has more of the flavor of the original story, but offers less visual appeal to young children.

In the midst of contemplating his confinement, Blanqui devises a simple calculation in which the infinity of time is confronted with the finite number of possible events to suggest a most radical conclusion: every chain of events is bound to repeat itself eternally in space and time. Our lives are being lived an infinity of times across the confines of the universe, and death, defeat, success and glory are never final. For the world is nothing but the play of probabilities on the great stage of time and space. By straddling the boundaries of hyperrealism and hallucinatory thinking, Blanqui&#39;s hypothesis offers a deep, tragic, and heartfelt reflection on the place of the human in the universe, the value of action, and the aching that lies at the heart of every modern soul. This first critical edition of Blanqui&#39;s incantatory text in English features an extended introduction by Frank Chouraqui. Exploring sources of Blanqui&#39;s thinking in his intellectual context, Chouraqui traces the legacy of the text in critiques of modernity devoting particular attention to the figures of Nietzsche, Walter Benjamin, and Borges. It features copious illuminating annotations that bring out the web of connections which interlace the great marginal figure of Blanqui with more than two millennia of European culture.</p><p></p><h2>Innocent Erendira and Other Stories</h2><p><p>This collection of fiction, representing some of Garcï¿½a Mï¿½rquez's earlier work, includes eleven short stories and a novella, Innocent Erï¿½ndira, in which a young girl who dreams of freedom cannot escape the reach of her vicious and avaricious grandmother.</p></p><p><p>Gabriel Garcï¿½a Mï¿½rquez was born in 1927 in the town of Aracataca, Columbia.Latin America's preeminent man of letters, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982.

Set in the crazed, nationalistic Tokyo of late 1941, December 6 explores the coming world war through the other end of history&#39;s prism -- a prism held here by an unforgettable rogue and lover, Harry Niles. In many ways, Niles should be as American as apple pie: raised by missionary parents, taught to respect his elders and be an honorable and upright Christian citizen dreaming of the good life on the sun-blessed shores of California. But Niles is also Japanese: reared in the aesthetics of Shinto and educated in the dance halls and backroom poker gatherings of Tokyo&#39;s shady underworld to steal, trick and run for his life. As a gaijin, a foreigner --especially one with a gift for the artful scam -- he draws suspicion and disfavor from Japanese police. This potent mixture of stiff tradition and intrigue -- not to mention his brazen love affair with a Japanese mistress who would rather kill Harry than lose him -- fills Harry&#39;s final days in Tokyo with suspense and fear. Who is he really working for? Is he a spy? For America? For the emperor? Now, on the eve of Pearl Harbor, Harry himself must decide where his true allegiances lie. Suspenseful, exciting and replete with the detailed research Martin Cruz Smith brings to all his novels, December 6 is a triumph of imagination, history and storytelling melded into a magnificent whole.</p><p>Ever wonder how things might have been different for Rick Blaine, the ostensibly selfish nightclub owner from <i>Casablanca</i>, had he lived in Japan during the 1940s, rather than Morocco? Martin Cruz Smith offers a reasonable scenario in <i>December 6</i>.<p> This slickly plotted, exotically atmospheric thriller opens in Tokyo just a few days before bombs start raining on Pearl Harbor. There we meet roguish Harry Niles, the culturally conflicted son of religious missionaries and owner of the Happy Paris, a club known for its enigmatic jukebox jockey, Michiko, who also happens to be Harry's mistress. With war rumors rampant, Harry--distrusted by both U.S. and Japanese authorities--"was skipping town. Any sane person would." He has a seat waiting on what may be the final flight out to Hong Kong, and plans to escape from there to the States with a British diplomat's wife. But first, there are business and personal affairs to settle, not the least of which is an oil-tank con he's been running on the Imperial Navy--a desperate strategy to stop his beloved Japan from entering into self-destructive conflict with America. Harry also has to duck a sword-wielding military fanatic, who's seeking revenge for a long-ago incident that cost him honor, and bid sayonara to Michiko, a woman as scary as she is seductive. (Oh, well, at least they'll always have the Happy Paris.)</p><p> This book memorably re-creates wartime Tokyo, with its pet beetles and mincing geishas and naive belief that "victory lies in a faith in victory." Yet it's Harry Niles--cynical on top, sentimental beneath--who really carries <i>December 6</i>, a novel as brilliantly convoluted and captivating as any Smith (<i>Gorky Park</i> , <i>Havana Bay</i> ) has yet concocted. <i>--J.

The building itself was a derelict meat-packing factory, hastily converted to treat incoming wounded - both British and Argentine - even though two unexploded bombs lay at the back of the building. </p><p>Rick's diary of the campaign and its aftermath is a fast-paced and gripping account of war experience that covers the entire conflict from initial preparations and passage to the South Atlantic on the requisitioned liner Canberra to daily action reports, and observations and interaction with the key players of the conflict - Col. H. Jones, Brian Hanrahan, Julian Thompson and Max Hastings. Incredible human stories abound, as Rick, a trained commando, dangles from the rescue winch of a Sea King helicopter, saving lives on a daily basis. Yet he also confronts death in a thoughtful, reflective and considered way, helping others to deal with the trauma of war. </p><p>Now revised and brought fully up to date, this book is a unique first-hand narrative of a conflict that inspired individual and collective heroism among British armed forces, inspiring great pride in 'our boys' by the public back at home, but which also provoked - and continues to provoke - fierce debate.</p></p><p>Jolly manages to convey so much within a relatively small number of pages, the pace of all 74 days of the conflict immediately apparent. The highs written with dark humour ... The lows are written with a moving sensitivity. I will definitely be reading this one through again very soon. (<i>Rear Party Forum</i>)<br><br>This is a book for anyone interested in military medicine and psychology, anyone who just wants a fine testament to human endurance, leadership and stoicism in difficult and highly emotional circumstances, but perhaps most of all for veterans of the conflict who had little idea at the time of the miracles being worked on their colleagues as the battles raged around them. Personally, I found it absolutely compelling reading, filling another major jigsaw piece into the complex picture of those few short but bloody weeks in 1982. Highly recommended.

I open my show with it because I know people are gonna request it until I sing it. I wrote it myself, nine verses, and it broke my heart when I had to cut three verses out because it was too long. I could have written a thousand more verses, I've got so many memories of Butcher Holler.<br><br>To me, that place is the most important part of my life. My fans and writers are always making a big deal about me acting natural, right from the country. That's because I come from Butcher Holler, Kentucky, and I ain't never forgot it.<br><br>I'm always making Butcher Holler sound like the most backward part of the United States&#x2014;and I think maybe it is. I've travelled all over this country, down South and out West, and I ain't never seen anything like it. And I ain't making fun of it, because I'm the most backward person you ever saw. I never knew where babies came from until it happened to me.<br><br>This might give you an idea of how backward we are, but first, to appreciate this story, you've go to know that in eastern Kentucky we saw the word "press" instead of "closet." Anyway, one of my best friends is Dr. John Turner, who took care of me when I was younger. <br><br>Doc swears he saw this patient standing in front of the hospital elevator, looking confused. Doc asked him what was the matter, and the patient said, "Doc, I just seen a nurse get into that press&#x2014;and when the door opened she was gone!" See, that patient live in a holler all his life and never saw an elevator before. Myself, I never rode in an automobile until I was twelve.<br><br>Holler people are just different from anybody else. They live high up in the hills, one day at a time. There's probably a few who don't know who the president is, and there have been times when they were better off that way. Maybe things are changing now, with television and better roads and stuff, but I've got relatives living up in Butcher Holler who have never been further than Paintsville, ten miles away, in their lives. They're really beautiful people in their own way. Everybody else is worrying about the energy crisis, and talking about getting back to the simple things. My people are already there. If we run out of energy, my relatives know how to patch their houses and grow gardens, so they're gonna have the last laugh on everybody.<br><br>Let me explain where Butcher Holler is. You take any place in the United States today, and they've got an interstate highway, right? Well, you get on one of them interstates and drive to Huntington, West Virginia, which is already pretty hilly country&#x2014;but you ain't seen nothing yet. You get off Interstate 64 and head south along Highway 23 into Kentucky. That's a good three-lane highway going past some nice farms and factories and mobile homes. You drive for about an hour and a half until you get to Paintsville, which has around 4,000 people.<br><br>Paintsville may not look too big to outsiders, but in Johnson County it's the biggest thing going. That's the first place I ever saw a toilet with running water, just before I got married. I went into the bus station to go to the bathroom, but when I sat down on the seat, the toilet flushed automatically. I got so scared I was gonna get flushed down, I ran out of there and waited until we found a good old outhouse.<br>When I was a little girl, my big city was Van Lear, which was five miles away, a coal camp for the Consolidated Coal Company, with rows of wooden houses they rented to the miners. There must have been 10,000 people living around Van Lear in the good times. The company had a post office and company stores where you paid for you things in scrip. If you went into debt, you owed your soul to the company store, just like the song says. The company also had a recreation hall where they showed movies. People make coal camps sound like slavery, but in a lot of ways it was the best thing ever happened to people&#x2014;as long as coal kept running.<br><br>Before I was born, Van Lear was a boom town. The company kept their houses painted. The foremen had nice homes up on Silk Stocking row, and the bosses had real beautiful homes. Off to one side was a row of houses called Nigger Holler where the black miners lived. They worked in the mines with the whites, but they had to live off by themselves. I'm sure there was prejudice in the coal camps, but my family grew up so high in the hollers, we never knew about it.<br><br>My Daddy was color-blind in two ways. About the only color he could see real good was yellow, and I have troubled telling red from orange myself. But we were also color-blind about people. It's like in 1972, when I was up for the award for Best Female Singer on national television, and Charley Pride was going to present the award. People warned me not to kiss Charley in case I won, because it would hurt my popularity with country fans. I heard that one girl singer got canceled Down South after giving a little peck to a black friend on television. Well, Charley Pride is one of my favorite people in country music, and I got so mad that when I won I made sure I gave him a big old hug and a kiss right on camera. You know what? Nobody canceled on me. If they had, fine, I'd have gone home to my babies and canned some string beans and the heck with them all.</p><h2>Eng 2200</h2><p>A programed course in grammar and usage.</p><p></p><h2>Crafting a Patterned Home: Painting, Printing, and Stitching Projects to Enliven Every Room</h2><p><b>Create a unique space that's all your own--bold and colorful handmade projects to fill your home with pattern from color expert crafter extraordinaire Kristin Nicholas.</b><br><br>Jump into the world of pattern--get a crash course on the types of patterns and how they are made; learn how to gain inspiration and ideas from a variety of sources; explore ways of pairing different patterns together; and make patterns of your own to embellish your home.

Some 17,000 men and women passed through the ranks of the Polish Air Force while it was stationed on British soil in World War II. They not only played a crucial role in the Battle of Britian in 1940, but they also contributed significantly to the Allied war effort. They received 342 British gallantry awards.<br><br>Winston Churchill speaking about the Battle of Britain in 1940 said, "Never was so much owed by so many to so few."</p><p>Adam Zamoyski is a historian who has authored several books, including The Polish Way (Hippocrene Books), 1812: Napoleon&#39;s Fatal March on Moscow (Harper Perennial), and most recently, Chopin: Prince of the Romantics (Doubleday, 2010). He lives with his wife, the painter Emma Sergeant, in London.Fleeing to Britain after the Germans captured their homeland, the pilots of the Polish Air Force played an important role in the Battle of Britain and the air war in the European theater. Flying RAF planes, they shot down 745 enemy aircraft, with another 175 unconfirmed, and 190 flying bombs targeted at London. The British government was at first reluctant to utilize these military refugees, Zamoyski notes in his recap of familiar history, until heavy RAF losses in the defense of France and the evacuation at Dunkirk left Fighter Command no choice. Zamoyski (The Polish Way) chronicles the pilots' exploits in the skies over Europe and their warm relationship on the ground with the British people-especially the women-until the betrayal of their homeland by the Allies at the 1945 Yalta Conference. The story concludes sadly with an account of the development of anti-Polish feelings in Britain at war's end.

Miao, the clan elder, a wise, grave Siamese; Katar, loved by his followers and feared by his enemies; Hulo, the great warrior tom; Beraal, the beautiful queen, swift and deadly when challenged; Southpaw, the kitten whose curiosity can always be counted on to get him into trouble... Unfettered and wild, these and the other members of the tribe fear no one, go where they will, and do as they please. Until one day, a terrified orange-coloured kitten with monsoon green eyes and remarkable powers lands in their midst--the first in a series of extraordinary events that threatens to annihilate them and everything they hold dear.<br><i>The Wildings</i> is a gorgeous evocation of Delhi, a love paean to cats and a rich, often savage tale of survival and conquering one's fears.</p><p>NILANJANA ROY spent most of her adult life writing about humans before realizing that animals were much more fun; <i>The Wildings</i> is her first novel.

And among them will be workers who share an insight: in order to better our lot, we must act collectively to change the world. This profusely illustrated treasury of song sheets, lyrics, photographs, histories, and biographical sketches explores the notion that our best hope lies in the capacity of ordinary working people to emancipate ourselves and all of humanity. Featuring more than a dozen songwriters, from Joe Hill to Aunt Molly Jackson, <i>Working-Class Heroes</i> delivers a lyrical deathblow to the myth that so-called political songs of the 20th century were being written by intellectuals in New York. The songs collected here have a striking relevance to current affairs and invite us to explore the historical conditions that inspired their creation: systemic crisis, advancing fascism, and the threat of world war. These working-class songwriters showed courage and heroism that is&nbsp;immortal, and such heroes and their work should be celebrated still today. The heroes featured in this collection include&nbsp;Sarah Ogan Gunning, Ralph Chaplin, Woody Guthrie, Ella May Wiggins, Joe Hill, Paul Robeson, John Handcox, Aunt Molly Jackson, Jim Garland, Alfred Hayes, and Joseph Brandon.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Mat Callahan</b> is a musician and author of five books including <i>The Explosion of Deferred Dreams </i>and <i>A Critical Guide to Intellectual Property</i>.&nbsp;<b>Yvonne Moore</b> is a singer and bandleader.

In <i>Machete Season</i>, the veteran foreign correspondent Jean Hatzfeld reports on the results of his interviews with nine of the Hutu killers. They were all friends who came from a single region where they helped to kill 50,000 out of their 59,000 Tutsi neighbors, and all of them are now in prison, some awaiting execution. It is usually presumed that killers will not tell the truth about their brutal actions, but Hatzfeld elicited extraordinary testimony from these men about the genocide they had perpetrated. He rightly sees that their account raises as many questions as it answers.<br><br>Adabert, Alphonse, Ignace, and the others (most of them farmers) told Hatzfeld how the work was given to them, what they thought about it, how they did it, and what their responses were to the bloodbath. "Killing is easier than farming," one says. "I got into it, no problem," says another. Each describes what it was like the first time he killed someone, what he felt like when he killed a mother and child, how he reacted when he killed a cordial acquaintance, how 'cutting' a person with a machete differed from 'cutting' a calf or a sugarcane. And they had plenty of time to tell Hatzfeld, too, about whether and why they had reconsidered their motives, their moral responsibility, their guilt, remorse, or indifference to the crimes.<br><br>Hatzfeld's meditation on the banal, horrific testimony of the genocidaires and what it means is lucid, humane, and wise: he relates the Rwanda horror to war crimes and to other genocidal episodes in human history. Especially since the Holocaust, it has been conventional to presume that only depraved and monstrous evil incarnate could perpetrate such crimes, but it may be, he suggests, that such actions are within the realm of ordinary human conduct. To read this disturbing, enlightening and very brave book is to consider in a new light the foundation of human morality and ethics.<br></p><p>Jean Hatzfeld, an international reporter for Libï¿½ration since 1973, is the author of many books, including an earlier one on Rwanda and two on the war in Croatia and Bosnia.<br>Machete Season<br><i>Copyright ï¿½ 2003 by ï¿½ditions du Seuil Translation copyright ï¿½ 2005 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, LLC Preface copyright ï¿½ 2005 by Susan Sontag</i></p><h2>Under the Big Black Sun: California Art 1974-1981</h2><p>This comprehensive survey examines the fertile and diverse output of California artists during an extraordinary period of American history. The years between Richard Nixon&#x2019;s resignation and Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s election as president were difficult ones for America. Artists in particular were sensitive to enormous divisions in the country&#x2019;s moods and beliefs. Examining art-making in California during a tumultuous transitional period, this catalogue accompanying a remarkable exhibition features approximately 125 California artists working in a wide array of media: from installation art to representational painting, from conceptual art to performance art, and from video to photography. Penetrating essays by leading art historians, critics, and curators explore the history and development of pluralist art practices throughout California; the artists&#x2019; responses to questions about race, gender, politics, and war; and the emergence of new movements and trends such as punk, post-studio art, and postmodernism.

Clonk Clonk is a graphic account of a crippled youth's triumph over his tormentors in a primitive matriarchal society. Envoy Extraordinary is a tale of Imperial Rome where the emperor loves his illegitimate son more than his own arrogant, loutish heir.<br></p><p>William Golding was born in Cornwall in 1911 and was educated at Marlborough Grammar School and at Brasenose College, Oxford. Before he became a schoolmaster he was an actor, a lecturer, a small-boat sailor and a musician. A now rare volume, Poems, appeared in 1934. In 1940 he joined the Royal Navy and saw action against battleships, and also took part in the pursuit of the Bismarck. He finished the war as a Lieutenant in command of a rocket ship, which was off the French coast for the D-Day invasion, and later at the island of Welcheren. After the war he returned to Bishop Wordsworth&#39;s School in Salisbury and was there when his first novel, Lord of the Flies, was published in 1954. He gave up teaching in 1961. Lord of the Flies was filmed by Peter Brook in 1963. Golding listed his hobbies as music, chess, sailing, archaeology and classical Greek (which he taught himself). Many of these subjects appear in his essay collections The Hot Gates and A Moving Target. He won the Booker Prize for his novel Rites of Passage in 1980, and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1983. He was knighted in 1988. He died at his home in the summer of 1993. The Double Tongue, a novel left in draft at his death, was published in June 1995.</p><h2>Final Account (Inspector Banks Novels, 7)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Impressive. . . .

Detective Inspector Alan Banks and his assistant, Constable Susan Gay, are the lead investigators on the case. As Banks and Gay investigate, they reveal the victim to have been a conservative, quiet man virtually devoid of personality and style. But then a beautiful young musician sees Rothwell's picture in the paper and reveals that he had a secret life: as Robert Calvert, the musician's former lover. Meanwhile, Rothwell's financial dealings are coming into focus: he was skimming from one of his clients, a drug-dealing Caribbean dictator, and may have been murdered for his transgressions. The few loose ends to the case trouble Banks, and he pursues them until he draws a surprising conclusion.

Visit AnthonyBozza.netCrash and Burn CHAPTER 1<p></p> MY LIFE AS A PRIZEFIGHTER<p></p> <br>By the end of my eleven-year career on the Howard Stern Show, by my count I had gotten into a fight with literally every single person that worked for the show. These weren&#x2019;t one-round back-and-forth sparring matches: these were heavyweight insult slugfests with low blows, no rules, and blood on the canvas by the end of them. They went way beyond the acceptable level of shit giving and taking that defines the Stern universe because I drove them there directly. I could get under the skin of the most good-natured member of the crew on their happiest day because that&#x2019;s just what I do. If I decided that they were out to get me somehow or just decided that I didn&#x2019;t like them (probably because they seemed happy and I was a miserable drug addict who got a perverse thrill from destroying everything good in his life) I would lock on to my victim like a pit bull, keep at it until I found their soft spot, and force them to lose their temper in a very uncharacteristic way. I could make people become someone they didn&#x2019;t like, which suited me fine because I didn&#x2019;t like myself either.<br> <br>During my descent, I may not have been the best cohost, but I was one hell of a fighter: a slouching tiger, sleeping dragon, if you will. I might spend half a show sleeping, in other words nodding off on heroin, but I&#x2019;d wake up with more energy than an angry terrorist, ready to rail away at my target until I reduced them to the level of anger, loathing, insecurity, and frustration that I felt every single nonhigh hour of my day. Like I said, anger was a sick thrill for me: it got me going, it blew off steam, and it made me feel alive. And obviously I didn&#x2019;t care about the consequences it had on the relationships in my life, so it became a bit of a hobby&#x2014;the kind of hobby your friends have that you wish they didn&#x2019;t. Usually those friends aren&#x2019;t too receptive when you try to tell them that collecting paintings by serial killers isn&#x2019;t going to get them laid.<br> <br>I got into a fight with Robin, I got into a fight with Gary, I got into a fight with Fred, I got into a fight with Sal, I got into a fight with Richard, I even got into a fight with Howard! How the fuck did I think that was okay? I got into so many fights on the air that they made a &#x201c;Best of Artie&#x2019;s Fights&#x201d; special after I was gone that they still replay all the time. I know this because every time it airs, if I go outside at all that day&#x2014;even for just five minutes&#x2014;someone in a passing car will roll their window down and shout at me about it. This sounds bad, but it isn&#x2019;t; usually they are informing me of this in a good way. The most famous of these fights was quite the spectacle, even in audio form, and if you&#x2019;re lucky or cursed enough to have seen the video of this event then you know exactly what I&#x2019;m talking about. Aside from all that, this incident is significant because it marks a major downturn in my efficiency as a functioning drug addict. I am referring to a fight that stands alone: my battle royale with my old assistant Teddy.<br> <br>In April of 2008, I completely lost it on Teddy one day on the air. I insulted him, I threatened him, I made fun of him in every way possible, and I topped it all off by throwing a cup of water at him. I&#x2019;d been munching painkillers like they were Tic Tacs all night, so I was flying high that morning. I was also pretty exhausted. I&#x2019;d been keeping up the schedule that drove me into the ground and had played a big LA gig that month after which I planned to relax and wean myself off of the drugs, which would have been the sensible thing to do. Instead I went to Amsterdam.<br> <br>One of the Stern Show producers, Jason Kaplan, was having a four-day bachelor party there, and great people were going, including Howard TV cameraman Brian Phelan, who is one of my favorite people from the show to hang out with. The flight out was that night, just a few hours after our blowup. On the show that morning, Howard asked about the trip and if we were all packed and ready to go. I remembered that I&#x2019;d asked Teddy to make a copy of my passport so he&#x2019;d have all of my information handy for filling out customs forms and in case I lost it, which was a distinct possibility. Teddy was, after all, my assistant, and these are the kind of tasks assistants are told to do if they aren&#x2019;t on top of it enough to think of these things themselves, which was definitely the case with my flunky manservant. The number of times Teddy didn&#x2019;t do things he should have done is almost as legendary as the number of times I fell asleep on the air during my last year on the show, but no matter what he did, I believed in Teddy because I liked the kid a lot and wanted him to be all that he could be. So that day, I expected that he&#x2019;d done what I&#x2019;d asked him to, regardless of his track record.<br> <br>A couple of hours into the show, during a break, a kid who worked at Sirius&#x2014;not even on our show&#x2014;came up to me, handed me my passport, and told me he&#x2019;d found it in the copier machine, where Teddy had apparently left it. This was a major fuckup, even for him, because if someone hadn&#x2019;t found that and returned it, we would have gone to the airport and I would have been completely fucked. We would have missed the plane, because there is no way in hell I&#x2019;d let Teddy go and have fun if I couldn&#x2019;t, and by the time we got ourselves over there we would have probably lost two days.<br> <br>At first I just thought it was funny. Shit happens; we all do dumb shit, and I&#x2019;ve done shit that&#x2019;s dumber than most. Luckily my dumb shit has turned out okay&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. most of the time. So with all that in mind I did what any self-respecting wiseass would do if their friend&#x2014;let alone their paid assistant&#x2014;fucked up that big: I started busting Teddy&#x2019;s balls. During the next commerical break I went and found him and started laying into him in a pretty lighthearted way that was nowhere close to how rude I&#x2019;d been to him in the past for lesser crimes. I considered it gentle teasing, which he deserved to say the least, but it didn&#x2019;t take long for this exchange to turn into something violent. It literally took one cross word from Teddy.<br> <br>After the break, back on the air, I told Howard what he&#x2019;d done and when Teddy heard me, he barged into the studio to defend himself. He was offended and defensive and took no blame, and this flipped my crazy switch, shifting my tone in the argument from civil to insane. I was outraged that Teddy wasn&#x2019;t at all apologetic; I really couldn&#x2019;t believe it. To me, there is no excuse for leaving your boss&#x2019;s passport in a copy machine that everyone in our office&#x2014;which is huge&#x2014;has access to. I wasn&#x2019;t going to let him make any kind of excuse, because there was none.<br> <br>I went right at the punk, because that&#x2019;s what he was to me at that point, and brought up the fact that he owed me two thousand dollars. The exchange that ensued was crazy. I started calling him gay because one time he&#x2019;d shortened the word &#x201c;Bloomingdale&#x2019;s&#x201d; to &#x201c;Bloomie&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who says that?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;He might be gay.&#x201d;<br> <br>My reasoning was twofold: I&#x2019;d dropped my mother and sister off at Bloomingdale&#x2019;s but I&#x2019;d never been inside, I&#x2019;m proud to say. The fact that Teddy had been in there multiple times and had adopted a nickname for the place was suspect. Referring to it as &#x201c;Bloomie&#x2019;s&#x201d;? I had a huge problem with that. Who says that? He&#x2019;s such a pussy. I took that train of thought to the wall and still wasn&#x2019;t done because by then pure anger and hatred were streaming out of me. Things escalated until I reached my breaking point, which was the moment Teddy said that I forced the money on him. Forced. It&#x2019;s still an insane notion, and in my state that was it, I was out-of-control pissed off. I&#x2019;d loaned him the money, but the way he talked about it that morning sounded as if he felt entitled to it and didn&#x2019;t feel he had to pay it back. I fucking lost it and all hell broke loose. Before I go on I&#x2019;d like to emphasize that I overreacted here and I do apologize once again to Teddy.<br> <br>Anyway, I threw my water at him and dove across the desk hoping to get my hands around his neck. I missed pretty badly on both counts so I got up, sending my chair crashing into the wall and ran after him because by then he was out of there. It was the fastest I&#x2019;d ever seen him do anything. Benjy, who is a comedy writer I love and adore who wrote jokes for Howard and sat right next to me for years, tried to stop me but he couldn&#x2019;t. As fat as I am, I&#x2019;m strong as hell, especially when I&#x2019;m angry. So as Teddy ran for his life, Ronnie, Gary, and a few interns worked together to hold me back. Hands down, this was my worst moment on the air, which is saying a lot considering my track record. Still, I know some of you Stern freaks out there probably think it&#x2019;s the best thing you&#x2019;ve ever heard. As much as I think you&#x2019;re sick fucks, I hope you weirdos never change.<br> <br>As I saw Teddy get away, I became more of a maniac by that point, enraged and inconsolable, and underneath it all embarrassed and ashamed. I saw Howard in the middle of it and stopped in my tracks, finally realizing what I&#x2019;d done and what I was still doing. I wasn&#x2019;t close to cooling down, but I had a moment of clarity. Howard and the show meant so much to me, and in that flash I forgot whatever whirlwind of hate I was caught up in and got some perspective.<br> <br>I stopped struggling, I stopped yelling, and I went and hugged him. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t deserve to be here after this, Howard,&#x201d; I said. I was struggling to hold back my tears. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I disrespected you and I&#x2019;m sorry I disrespected the show. Good-bye. I don&#x2019;t deserve to be here.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was about an hour remaining in the broadcast when I stormed out, and I had never done that before, even on my worst days. I got out of the elevator and onto the street thinking that I&#x2019;d resigned because I&#x2019;d meant what I said: I didn&#x2019;t deserve to be there. I spent the rest of the day walking up and down Sixth Avenue, completely out of it. After a few hours, with nowhere to go, I went to the movies and tried to doze off and forget about my life. I have no idea what I saw, I just remember people in the theater yelling at me because my cell phone kept ringing as calls and texts from concerned people came in. I know what you&#x2019;re thinking, but c&#x2019;mon, you really think I know how to put that shit on mute? I just found out about this thing they call e-mail.<br> <br>Everyone in my life called me that afternoon, all of them trying to stop me from going on the trip, but that wasn&#x2019;t gonna happen. I was so determined to carry on that I would have told the president of the United States or Greg Nettles himself that we&#x2019;d have to have dinner another time because there was a bachelor party in Amsterdam that I had to get to. So that evening, with all this bullshit unresolved, without having talked to anyone since walking off the show, I boarded the plane with Teddy, Brian, Jason, and the rest of the guys and flew to Amsterdam, Holland, for four days of male bonding and good times.<br> <br>I was at the very height of my heroin addiction, by the way, which, factoring travel, lies, and other people, made for a perfectly tossed salad of shit, dressed in piss vinaigrette. Our fight on the air was a giant danger sign to everyone around me, most of whom didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d come back alive from a city infamous for liberal drug laws and an ample supply of heroin, pills, and hookers. They saw a sugar-mad kid heading unattended into Candy Land.<br> <br>Things started out all right because I slept through most of the flight, but what really helped was that I was booked into a different hotel than the other guys. I had the cash to burn, so I&#x2019;d booked a suite in a five-star establishment a couple of miles away from them. The first night I crashed hard because I still had a lot to sleep off, but by four p.m. the next day I was rested and ready to begin my version of a well-earned vacation: isolation and getting high. I had no problem celebrating Jason&#x2019;s upcoming nuptials my way because in my mind that was still honoring him, so I got into a cab and told the driver to find me some fun. He took one look at me and made a beeline for the Red Light District, where I bought a bunch of pills from some guy on the street who was wearing a beret. I remember wondering if that was Amsterdam code for &#x201c;dealer holding.&#x201d; As a rule, berets piss me off on sight and I refuse to talk to anybody wearing them, but this guy got a pass for life. He had every opiate I&#x2019;d ever heard of, so I bought a sack of his pills, then went looking for a hooker, which is my chaser of choice for a double shot of opiates. I found myself a solid seven and negotiated a rate that would get her back to my hotel. This chick was a hooker through and through, which is really what you want when hiring a prostitute. Any guy who kids himself that a woman for hire is his girlfriend, even while it&#x2019;s happening, is a complete idiot. The fucking business is a fucking business, so act accordingly and everyone will go home happy.<br> <br>This broad was amazing, just completely a prostitute. There was no way anyone at the hotel from the bellboy to the bartender to the desk clerk manning the graveyard shift was going to address her as &#x201c;Mrs. Lange.&#x201d; And she was so accommodating: as high as I was at the time, I will never forget how understanding she was that I hadn&#x2019;t changed my American dollars into Euros. She and I spent the rest of the night talking, while crushing and snorting every flavor we could find in the bag of pills I&#x2019;d scored. She spoke decent English, and we only had sex once, because like drugs addicts will do, the time we spent together was all about the drugs. I was enjoying myself, so the next day, I refused to get in touch with the other guys, even though they&#x2019;d left me a few messages. I remembered back to shooting Dirty Work in Toronto in 1998, with Chris Farley, because Farley would pay whores to just sit around, smoke weed with him, and keep him company because he was lonely. That&#x2019;s where my head was at&#x2014;after banging her once, I was fascinated by the idea of paying a pretty woman to be my friend for the day. I was as far gone as Farley had been: I just wanted to spend an afternoon with a friend who wouldn&#x2019;t judge any awful thing I did. When it comes to hookers the sex is secondary in my opinion. The love you rent from them isn&#x2019;t real, but it&#x2019;s unconditional, and when you&#x2019;re a using, struggling drug addict, love and a lack of judgment are exactly what you need.<br> <br>I never got her real name, but I did make one up for this broad: in my mind I started calling her Whoreguide&#x2122; because the moment we got outside she&#x2019;d start giving me the history of the city. She was incredible! I started enjoying her company so much that I dodged all the guys&#x2019; calls and texts and took her on a cruise through the canals of the city. I was staying at The Dylan, which is a very posh hotel, and there were sightseeing boats parked outside in the canal waiting to take rich tourists sightseeing by water. It was downright wholesome: me, the guy driving the boat, and Whoreguide&#x2122; taking in Amsterdam&#x2019;s historical highlights together. We saw centuries-old town houses, government buildings, famous residences, the Anne Frank House&#x2014;all of this and more lay on either side in all their splendor.<br> <br>Once again I&#x2019;ve gotta hand it to Whoreguide&#x2122;: she was one informed whore. She knew more about the history of Amsterdam than the boat tour guide by a long shot. The only thing he taught me was where to get breakfast. That guy, whom for the sake of argument we&#x2019;re going to call Goebbels, had a crisp Dutch accent and high-strung voice. Basically he sounded li...</p><h2>The Jolly Postman/Postcard Collection</h2><p>The popular Jolly Postman returns with a collection of thirty standard-size postcards, suitable for mailing, featuring fifteen images from the Jolly Postman books.

Jeff, Norby, and Admiral Boris Yobo travel to remote planet Izz, where--on the eve of the annual toy festival--trouble looms: Norby's robot-love Pera has vanished; Princess Rinda and her father are quarantined with Ickyspot; the Mainbrain One computer is acting erratic; and someone has introduced a computer game, Teenytrip, that has mesmerized the entire population into expecting major change. Suspicion centers on Ing, an Earth scoundrel exiled to Izz as court jester; worse, police chief Luka has fallen in love with him. But the villain is really beautiful singer Xeena, who turns out to be cousin to the queen, and who- -using what looks like a hairpin but is actually a computer key- -has awakened Mainbrain Two in a plot to take her rightful place in the royal family. All is resolved: Xeena is welcomed, Ing and Luka are united, and the expectations for change are satisfied by introducing parliamentary rule. That all clear? Part old-fashioned Saturday movie serial, part G&amp;S operetta, and all preposterous: good, clean fun, and the loose ends can go into another book. (Fiction. 10-14) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Grade 4-6-- Fans of the Norby books (Walker) and newcomers alike will enjoy this rollicking adventure. Space Cadet Jeff Wells and his robot Norby are planning a vacation on the planet Izz. Admiral Yobo, head of Jeff's academy, decides to join them to escape his federation duties. Thanks to Norby's ability to travel through hyperspace, the three are quickly dropped into the odd world of Izz, which will be familiar to readers of the previous books. Evil Ing has become court jester, and Jeff soon suspects him of hatching a plot to overthrow the monarchy. The story unfolds quickly, and the mystery element has just enough suspense to give readers a feeling of accomplishment when they solve it. For even reluctant readers with a computer interest, this is good fun and an excellent hook to other books in the series. --Anne Connor, Los Angeles Public Library<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Comstar (Battletech Sourcebook, 1655)</h2><p>The Comstar Sourcebook recounts the organization&#39;s history, describes the technology it preserved, and reveals the circumstances that broke it apart.

Ricketts: the shaping of a novelist</h2><p>Edward F. Ricketts, a marine biologist who lived on the Monterey waterfront in California, was a close friend of John Steinbeck, the novelist. As Professor Astro makes clear, no analysis of Steinbeck&#x2019;s writing can proceed without a careful study of the life, work, and ideas of Ricketts, who was Steinbeck&#x2019;s closest personal and intellectual companion for nearly two decades. <p> Ricketts went to California from Chicago in 1923, and from that time until his death in 1948 he operated a biological supply house at Pacific Grove. Steinbeck and Ricketts met in 1930 and struck an immediate friendship. Together they planned a handbook on the marine invertebrates of the San Francisco Bay region. Although this project was never carried out, it paved the way for another venture, a collecting expedition to the Gulf of California which resulted in their collaboration on Sea of Cortez: A Leisurely Journal of Travel and Research, the published record of that trip. As Professor Astro points out, Ricketts served, in varying degrees, as the source of characters in six of Steinbeck&#x2019;s novels and novelettes and one short story. Perhaps more importantly, the author shows that many of Steinbeck&#x2019;s central thematic tenets were provided by Ricketts&#x2019; passion for holistic and ecological thinking, his associational beliefs about the behavior of men and animals in groups, and his disdain for the acquisition of material wealth. But, he warns, "to say that all of Steinbeck&#x2019;s concern with science in general and with marine biology in particular came directly from Ricketts is to distort the facts." </p><p> By analyzing the range and depth of Ricketts&#x2019; impact on Steinbeck&#x2019;s fiction, this book places a major writer in fresh perspective. </p><p> Richard Astro is an associate professor of English at Oregon State University.</p></p><p>It is with great pleasure that Western Flyer Publishing introduces a new issue of Professor Richard Astro&#x2019;s fine book, John Steinbeck and Edward F. Ricketts The Shaping of a Novelist. Without the knowledge contained within these pages, one can not properly assess or, for that matter, appreciate the writings of John Steinbeck. Also locked inside the covers of the book one finds the most complete description of the life and philosophies of Edward Ricketts, who, without his deep participation, America might never had the opportunity of experiencing the finest works of Steinbeck. This in no way denigrates the work of Steinbeck, or elevates Ricketts to the status of novelist, but is the finest example of how genius, like all of nature, abhors a vacuum. It is the story of how creativity can be expanded exponentially through synergy, and of how contingency, those factors of randomness that rule the universe, sometimes bring together great minds at just the precise time, and the final product becomes magic. <p>Since I first read John Steinbeck and Edward F. Ricketts The Shaping of a Novelist, it has been my desire to get this book back into general circulation so that Professor Astro&#x2019;s words could be made more readily available to all that have a greater interest in the interactions of two fascinating individuals. Most know about Steinbeck, many know of a "Doc&#x2019; who occurs in various guises in many of Steinbeck&#x2019;s works, but few know of the real Ed Ricketts, and even fewer know the extent of Ed&#x2019;s thoughts on Steinbeck&#x2019;s work. </p><p>David Loper </p><p>Publisher </p><p>Western Flyer Publishing </p><p>2002</p>Professor Richard Astro has authored and co-authored many works on John Steinbeck and other literary notables.

Under me is a white blanket. I'm fascinated by the pure blue sky, but Topsy the goat is chained to my right -- out of reach they think. The sound of her grazing comes steadily closer. I've sat on her back, she pulls my cart, I'm not afraid. Suddenly though she is here above me, a stiff rank smell. She licks my forehead in rough strokes of a short pink tongue. Then she begins to pull hard at what I'm wearing. I don't understand that she's eating my diaper. I push at her strong head and laugh for the first time yet in my life. I'm free to laugh since my parents are nearby, talking on the porch. They'll be here shortly, no need to cry out. I'm four or five months old and still happy, sunbathing my body that was sick all winter. </p><p> That scene is my earliest sure memory; and it poses all the first questions -- how does a newborn child learn the three indispensable human skills he is born without? How does he learn to live, love, and die? How do we learn to depend emotionally and spiritually on others and to trust them with our lives? How do we learn the few but vital ways to honor other creatures and delight in their presence? And how do we learn to bear, use and transmit that knowledge through the span of a life and then to relinquish it? </p><p> I've said that all but one of my student writers have located their earliest memory in the third or fourth year. My own first memory appears to be a rare one. The incident was often laughed about in my presence at later gatherings -- the day poor Topsy went for Reynolds's diaper, got a good whiff and bolted. So I might have built a false memory from other people's narratives. But I'm still convinced that the scene I've described is a fragment of actual recall, stored at the moment of action. If it wasn't I'd have embellished the scene further -- adding clouds to the sky, a smell to the grass, the pitch of my parents' voices. What I've written is what I have, an unadorned fragment that feels hard and genuine. And the only trace of emotion is my lack of fear, my pleasure, both of which produced my first awareness of dependency -- the goat won't eat me; help is near. </p><p> From the presence of Topsy, I know I'm in Macon, North Carolina. She was born, the same day as I, on my Uncle Marvin Drake's farm up near the Roanoke River. My father has had a small red goat-cart built, big enough for me and one child-passenger; and Topsy is already strong enough to pull us. Since we left Macon before I was a year old, then the memory comes from my first summer in 1933. That February 1st, I'd been born in the far west bedroom of my mother's family home in Macon. </p><p> Macon was then a village of under two hundred people, black and white. Because it was an active station on the Seaboard Railroad's Raleigh-to-Norfolk line, it had grown north and south from the depot in the shape of a Jerusalem cross-a north-south dirt street, an east-west paved road parallel to the train tracks and a few dirt streets parallel still to both axes. </p><p> There was a minuscule but thriving business district -- three grocery and dry-goods stores, a gas station and a post office. There were two brick white churches, Methodist and Baptist, and two frame black churches, one on the west edge and one in the country. There were fewer than forty white households, mostly roomy but unpretentious frame houses, no pillared mansions. A few smaller black houses were set in the midst of town with no hint of threat or resentment; but most black families lived on the fringes of town -- some in solid small houses, some in surprisingly immortal-seeming hovels. And on all sides, the sandy fields of tobacco and cotton lay flat and compliant, backed by deep woods of pine and cedar and big-waisted hardwoods. </p><p> Almost every white family employed one or more black women, men and children as farm hands, house servants, yardmen, gardeners and drivers. With all the deep numb evil of the system (numb for whites)-slavery and servitude did at least as much enduring damage to whites as to blacks -- those domestic relations were astonishingly good-natured and trusting, so decorous that neither side began to explore or understand the other's hidden needs. When they'd granted one another the hunger for food, shelter and affection, their explorations apparently ceased; and the ancient but working standoff continued. </p><p> Yet a major strand of the harmony of all their lives consisted of the easy flow of dialogue expressive of mutual dependency, jointly sparked fun and the frequent occasions of mutual exasperation. There were even glints of rage from each side; but in our family homes at least, there was never a word about the tragic tie that bound the two peoples. And if a cook or yardman mysteriously failed to appear on Monday morning, even the kindest white employer was sure to foment angrily on the blatant no-count ingratitude -- no trace of acknowledgement that a bonedeep hostile reluctance might be fuming. </p><p> Since the family trees of strangers are high on anyone's boredom scale, I'll limit the following to what seems bare necessity if I'm to track these mysteries. My mother Elizabeth Martin Rodwell was born in <i>1905</i> and reared in Macon in the oak-shaded rambling white seven-room house built by her father in the mid-<i>1888</i>os. He was John Egerton Rodwell, station master of the Macon depot. He'd grown up in a big nest of brothers on a farm, some four miles north, between Macon and Churchill. His mother Mary Egerton, whether she knew it or not, could have claimed descent from the English family that commissioned John Milton to write his masque <i>Comus</i> in 1634 to celebrate the elevation of John Egerton, Earl of Bridgewater, to the Lord Presidency of Wales (the leading player in <i>Comus</i> was his daughter Alice Egerton, age fifteen). While the memory of such a standing was retained by a few of the deep-country farmers my Egertons had become, after two centuries in slaveholding Virginia and North Carolina, they seldom bragged on their blood. </p><p> My mother Elizabeth's mother was Elizabeth White -- called Lizzie, even on her gravestone -- from the oldest continuously settled part of the state, Perquimans County in the northeast corner, eighty miles east of Macon. Lizzie's mother had died in Lizzie's infancy, and she had been reared by her storekeeper father and an agreeable stepmother. On a visit to friends in Macon, she met blackhaired, brown-eyed funny Jack Rodwell; and she married him soon after. She was all of sixteen, mirthful and pleasantly buxom (a later problem), not pretty but widely loved for her good talk, her endless self-teasing and much ready laughter. </p><p> She was fated to bear eight children in twenty years, seven of whom survived her. One boy died in his first year; the other three left home early, in the common Dickensian fashion. They packed their small belongings, kissed their parents (all my kin flung themselves on kisses with the recklessness of Russian premiers), flagged the train and headed up the line for railroad jobs in Norfolk, already a teeming port of the U.S. Navy. Of the four daughters, my mother Elizabeth was the youngest. Lizzie used to claim that Elizabeth was conceived because, well after Lizzie thought she was done, the Seaboard added a four a.m. express. Its window-rattling plunge through the heart of Macon would wake Jack nightly and leave him with nothing better to do in the dark than turn to his mate. </p><p> My father William Solomon Price was born in <i>1900</i> in Warrenton, the small county-seat five miles from Macon. Before the Civil War, the town was a social and political center of the state (a local statesman Nathaniel Macon was Speaker of the House of Representatives in the presidency of Thomas Jefferson). As such it was the home of wealthy slaveholding planters, many of whose elegant houses have lately been refurbished, though Warrenton now shares the sad lot of all bypassed farm towns -- its children leave. </p><p> Will's father -- Edward Price, a famed dry wit -- was a son of the town carriage-maker, of Welsh and Scottish stock; Edward's mother was a Reynolds from Perth, Scotland. Barely out of boyhood and balked by Reconstruction poverty from his hope to study medicine, Edward avoided the family business and clerked for the remainder of his life in the county's Registry of Deeds. Will's mother was Lula McCraw, also of Warrenton and the descendant of Scottish, English and French Huguenot immigrants. One of her third-great-grandfathers was James Agee, a Huguenot whom we share with our Tennessee cousin, the writer James Agee. Lula Price was small, with a bright voracious mind, watchful as a sparrow and capable of winging a startlingly ribald comment from behind her lace and cameo with such swift wit as to leave the beauty of her face unmarred. Her short narrow body bore six strong children, all of whom survived her; yet she found the energy to run a ten-room house generously, almost lavishly, on her husband's modest income with a strength of mind and hand that, again, her white-petal beauty belied. </p><p> My parents met six years before their marriage. The meeting was in 1921 when Will was twenty-one and Elizabeth sixteen. They'd each gone to a dance at Fleming's Mill Pond, with other dates -- Will with Sally Davis, Elizabeth with Alfred Ellington. Elizabeth's date introduced her to Will; and despite Sally Davis's beauty and wit, an alternate circuit at once lit up. First, both Will and Elizabeth looked fine and knew it, within reason. Second, they were both storage batteries of emotional hunger and high-voltage eros. And third, their short pasts -- which felt like eons -- had left each one of them craving the other's specific brand of nourishment. </p><p> Will had graduated from high school four years earlier and had since held easy jobs, none of which required him to go more than a few hundred yards from his family home, while continuing to sleep and board with his parents. His two elder brothers had gone as far as was imaginable then, to Tennessee; but all three of his witty and unassuaged sisters were still in place -- the eldest having left her husband and returned unannounced at the age of twenty with a young son to live for good in the shadow of her father, whom she loved above all and whose deathbed pillows were found in her cedar chest at her own death, more than fifty years later. Both Will's parents were in hale, testy, often hilarious control; so the house contained eight Prices in five bedrooms, plus at least one cook and a handyman. </p><p> I can hardly think how a healthy young man, between the ages of seventeen and twenty-seven, can have stood to inhabit such a crowd of watchers and feeders -- and stood them, day and night, for ten years after finishing high school -- but stand them he did. As the youngest son, Will was his mother's "eyeballs." And later evidence suggests that she unconsciously mastered his growing dependence on alcohol to keep him close to an all-forgiving bosom (Elizabeth told me, late in her life, that "Will's mother would ride with him to the bootlegger when no one else would go"). </p><p> For whatever reasons, Will's extrication from the grip of such a rewarding and demanding mother -- and from his fondness for Sally Davis -- took him six long years of fervent courting. And once he and Elizabeth had steeled themselves, they married as far from Warren County as they could go and still be sheltered by kin. Elizabeth's nextoldest, and favorite, brother Boots gave her away in Portsmouth, Virginia; and in Warrenton, Will's sisters rose at dawn to set all the clocks in the Price house an hour ahead. Then at "noon" -- as the distant vows seemed imminent and their mother announced her imminent heartspell -- they could say "Just calm yourself, Muddy; it's too late now. Will and Elizabeth are a whole hour married and on the <i>train."</i> And so they were -- the Orange Blossom Special, in a "drawing room" suite (courtesy of Elizabeth's Seaboard brothers) and bound for Florida, one of the gorgeous ends of the Earth in those grand days. </p><p> Elizabeth's parents had died young. When my mother was eleven, Lizzie's kidneys failed; and Elizabeth was led to her mother's deathbed-surrounded by galvanized tubs of ice to cool the fierce heat -- for a final goodbye. Three years later, sitting on her own porch, Elizabeth looked up the dirt road to see a mail cart from the depot roll toward her. It bore her last anchor -- Jack Rodwell her father, dead of his second stroke at fifty-eight. </p><p> From the age of eleven, Elizabeth and her sister Alice, called Britsy and five years older, were mothered by their kind sister Ida. Ida was eighteen years older than Elizabeth; and with her came her then-volatile husband Marvin Drake and their three boys. Though they were Elizabeth's near-contemporary nephews, they quickly became her surrogate brothers, foster sons and chief playmates. </p><p> The Drakes had moved in at Lizzie's death to keep house for Jack and the girls; and once Jack died, they stayed for good. Ever after, Elizabeth's feelings about the years of at-home orphanhood were understandably mixed. She was grateful for the chance to remain in her birthplace with mostly well-intentioned kinfolk. But on rare occasions in my own childhood, I'd see her ambushed by sudden resentment. In those short forays, she'd glimpse the worst -- she'd been dispossessed in her rightful place by an interloper with a cold eye for gain, a brother-in-law (who would ultimately purchase the Rodwell children's shares in the home and will it and all its Rodwell contents to his Drake heirs). In a few days though, I'd hear her say "Let's drive up home and see Ida and Marvin." In her best mind, my mother knew they'd kept her alive. </p><p> Will and Elizabeth were reared then in classic, though healthily honest, family situations where blood-love, or at least loyalty, was the binding principle of a majority of the by-no-means happy populace. As an inevitable and paradoxical result, my young parents were primed for another love, private but transcendent, that would lead them out of the blighting shadows of their homes into the glare of their own graceful bodies in one another's hands, worked as they were by aching need. </p><p> The repeatable public stories of their courtship were among my own favorites from their long repertoire. There was the night when, returning from a performance of <i>The Merry Widow</i> in Henderson, Will left his Model A Ford for a moment to buy cigarettes; and Elizabeth, still too well-mannered to mention a body-need, was forced to lift the floorboard and pee quickly on the hot gear box. It reeked mysteriously through the rest of Will's evening. Or the time the same car got bogged in quicksand and almost sank them. Or the hard days of Will's terror when Elizabeth suffered a ruptured appendix, twenty years before the discovery of antibiotics, and was rushed in agony from Macon to Norfolk on a stretcher in the baggage car of a train -- the only place she could ride flat -- for six weeks of desperate but successful remedies. Or Elizabeth's happiest memory of her strongly ambivalent mother-in-law -- the time they were driving alone together, struck a turkey, killed it neatly and brought it home to eat.

Sauron, the Dark Lord, has gathered to him all the Rings of Power; the means by which he intends to rule Middle-earth. All he lacks in his plans for dominion is the One Ring -- the ring that rules them all -- which has fallen into the hands of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as the Ring is entrusted to his care. He must leave his home and make a perilous journey across the realms of Middle-earth to the Crack of Doom, deep inside the territories of the Dark Lord. There he must destroy the Ring forever and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose. Discover the incredible epic journey of Frodo in a celebratory seven-volume boxed set of fantasy classic, The Lord of the Rings.</p><p>This is a single-volume edition of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, in which the hobbit Frodo and his elfish friends get swept up in a mighty conflict with the dark lord Sauron (who owes much to proud Satan in <i>Paradise Lost</i>), the monstrous Gollum, the Cracks of Doom, and the awful power of the magical Ring. The book's characters--good and evil--are recognizably human, and the realism is deepened by the magnificent detail of the vast parallel world Tolkien devised, inspired partly by his influential Anglo-Saxon scholarship and his Christian beliefs. (He disapproved of the relative sparseness of detail in the comparable allegorical fantasy his friend C.S. Lewis dreamed up in the Chronicles of Narnia, though he knew Lewis had spun a page-turning yarn.) It has been estimated that one-tenth of all paperbacks sold can trace their ancestry to J.R.R. Tolkien. But even if we had never gotten Robert Jordan's <i>The Path of Daggers</i> and the whole fantasy genre Tolkien inadvertently created by bringing the hobbits so richly to life, Tolkien's epic about the Ring would have left our world enhanced by enchantment. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>Includes the 50th anniversary fully corrected text setting and an extensive new index"An extraordinary work -- pure excitement." -- <i>New York Times Book Review</i>One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them <br>In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. <br>From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion. <br>When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom. <br><i>The Lord of the Rings</i> tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider. <br>J.R.R. Tolkien (1892-1973), beloved throughout the world as the creator of <i>The Hobbit</i>, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, and <i>The Silmarillion</i>, was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College until his retirement in 1959. His chief interest was in the linguistic aspects of the early English written tradition, but while he studied classic works of the past, he was creating a set of his own.<br>For information on other books by and about J.R.R.

Plenty of flashes here - of wit, humor, insight, anger. But <i>Hot Flashes</i> has much more to offer: it builds to a conclusion that is powerful, moving and hopeful." - <i>Cincinnati Post</i></p><p>They were Depression babiesmembers of the Silent Generation that found its voice in the protest movements of the '60s. Twenty years later, they can only protest the encroachments of middle-age. Elaine, once the "political conscience" of their quartet, is now embittered and overweight. Joanne, gorgeous and trendy, is "unfulfilled," while Diana, a professor of anthropology, has distanced herself from most emotional ties. Sukie, the first to knit them all together (in her novels as well as in life) has just become the first to die. She leaves them an interesting, if inadvertent legacy: a journal that describes the painful break-up of her 20-year marriage and three men (her former husband and two lovers), thus making this the only book in which a three-day mourning ritual is converted into an impromptu singles weekend. Diana, who sees herself as "an authority on female rites of passage," is its narrator. Her rather heavy-handed insistence on the story's universality may lead readers to question just that. Unlike most women, those in Hot Flashes belong to a coterie that includes (as Diana often tells us) people like Shirley and Betty, Nora and Lois and Gloria. . . . The warmest current in this book stems from its understanding of friendship itself. 200,000 first printing; $200,000 ad/promo; BOMC alternate; author tour. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Somebody in Boots: A Novel (Classic Reprint Series)</h2><p>During the Depression, Cass McKay, a young man from Texas, is forced to ride the rails, live in hobo jungles, and search for handouts</p><p><b>Nelson Algren </b>(1909&#x2013;1981) was an American writer known for his novels about the poor.

Being here is worse than bug juice on a burger. Or homework on Thanksgiving. Or water seeping into my shoes. In this sequel to the critically acclaimed <i>Like Pickle Juice on a Cookie</i>, Eleanor is off to summer camp. At first she&#x2019;s excited to carry on the family tradition at Camp Wallumwahpuck, but when she gets there she finds icky bugs, terrible food, and worst of all: swim class, where she just can&#x2019;t seem to keep up with everyone else.

It is summer, and Eleanor's grandmother is sending her to Camp Wallumwahpuck. Though excited at first, she quickly finds herself homesick, as the only camp food she can stomach are the salads and rolls, and her bunk bed is near spiderwebs. Not only that, but she is stuck in the baby swimming group. Eleanor is mortified and miserable and just wants to go home. Of course, it is not long before she finds herself making friends, taking care of an adorable goat, and learning to swim. Maybe camp is not as awful as she thought. Eleanor is a likable character, and kids will relate to her unease at being far away from her family. The ending wraps up nicely, as the story is more about how she copes with a situation that is less than ideal and does not involve Eleanor having a complete change of heart.

Innes was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, where he was presented with the Matthew Arnold Memorial Prize and named a Bishop Frazer's scholar. After graduation, he went to Vienna to study Freudian psychoanalysis for a year and following his first book, an edition of Florio's translation of 'Montaigne', was offered a lectureship at the University of Leeds. In 1932 he married Margaret Hardwick, a doctor, and they subsequently had five children including Angus, also a novelist. The year 1936 saw Innes as Professor of English at the University of Adelaide, during which tenure he wrote his first mystery story, 'Death at the President's Lodging'. With his second, 'Hamlet Revenge', Innes firmly established his reputation as a highly entertaining and cultivated writer. After the end of World War II, he returned to the UK and spent two years at Queen's University, Belfast, where in 1949 he wrote the 'Journeying Boy', a novel notable for the richly comedic use of an Irish setting. He then settled down as a Reader in English Literature at Christ Church, Oxford, from which he retired in 1973. Innes's most famous character is 'John Appleby', who inspired a penchant for donnish detective fiction that lasts to this day. His other well-known character is 'Honeybath', the painter and rather reluctant detective, who first appeared in 1975 in 'The Mysterious Commission'. The last of the Innes novels, 'Appleby and the Ospreys', was published in 1986, some eight years before his death in 1994. His work is still very highly regarded and 'Appleby's End' and 'The New Sonia Wayward' were chosen by H.R.F. Keating as being amongst the best 100 crime novels ever written.

Guizot considers European civilization in its broadest senses, encompassing not merely political, economic, and social structures, but also the ideas, faculties, and sentiments of "man himself." Guizot understood a two-way relationship between external conditions affect the inner man, whose moral and intellectual development eventually shapes social and other external conditions.<br><br>Guizot's <i><b>History</b></i> describes the development of European civilization in terms of the inevitable advance of equality of conditions, due to many factors, including a new emphasis on the individual. The author explores the decentralization of power that characterized feudalism, the centralization of power after the fifteenth century, and finally the rebuilding of local autonomy necessary for representative and free government. As editor Larry Siedentop describes, "The [<i><b>History's</b></i>] moral is about the social and political consequences of destroying local liberty . . . excessive concentration of power at the center of any society is, in the long run, its own undoing."<br><br><b>Francois Guizot </b>(1787-1874) was a French historian, political philosopher, and politician.<br><br><b>Larry Siedentop</b> was educated at Hope College, Harvard, and Oxford.

With her beloved grandmother, Emer, dying in the hospital, Mary meets Tansey, her great-grandmother's ghost. Tansey has returned to assure Emer that dying is not so bad and "it'll all be grand." The narrative skips between time periods and the point of view alters among the perspectives of Mary, her mother, Emer, and Tansey. Readers learn that Tansey died of the flu in 1928 when Emer was only three and has been lingering near her ever since. The four generations of women go on a late-night road trip to the old family farm and the sea, a journey that allows them to learn about one another and helps them cope with past and future losses. The Irish dialect may delight some readers but frustrate others. Windows into the past give depth and meaning to each woman's struggle. The theme that love and affection are handed down through generations of women is a bit understated, but that's part of its charm. Occasionally, the frequent dialogue becomes tiresome and reads more like poetry. Pair this book with Jacqueline Kelly's The Evolution of Calpurnia Tate (Holt, 2009).

The lives of sixty-eight passengers and crew on board depended on his ability. A mile away was the 327-foot US Coast Guard Cutter George M. Bibb. The cutter&#39;s crew watched as the plane descended. If Sky Queen survived the landing, getting the passengers to safety would be their job. Nine years later and half a world away, Captain Richard Ogg, flying the Pan American Airways Stratocruiser Sovereign of the Skies, was forced ditch the aircraft along with its forty-three passengers and crew. The Coast Guard was nearby. Manning Ocean Station November was the US Coast Guard Cutter Pontchartrain. Once more, rescuing the survivors would be in their hands. In the Event of a Water Landing tells for the first time the full stories of the Bermuda Sky Queen and Sovereign of the Skies rescues, the only two completely successful open ocean ditchings in Commercial Aviation history. These two stories encompass many facets of ditchings: bad weather, engine failure, horrific sea conditions, and indomitable courage in the face of death. Between these two are tales of other ditchings as well as the journey we humans have undertaken from the beginning of transoceanic flight to today. Using the voices of passengers, flight crew, and those who rescued them, an amazing tale unfolds. Their vivid memories, interspersed with contemporary news reports, serve to flesh out the unemotional entries from official investigations. These ditchings and rescues embody the hopes, fears, and courage of people facing death hundreds of miles from land and the audacity of the men who risked their own lives to save them.</p><p>In June 2004, Walling&#39;s first book, Bloodstained Sea: The U.S. Coast Guard in the Battle of the Atlantic 1941-1944, was published by International Marine, a division of McGraw-Hill, and received critical acclaim by reviewers and veterans. The Naval Order of the United States honored him with its 2005 Samuel Eliot Morison Award for Naval Literature. He appeared on the History Channel series Man, Moment, Machine episode about Andrew Higgins, the designer and builder of the vital landing craft used in World War II, and, as a script consultant for the episode, reviewed the material for accuracy. On the lighter side, Walling published, in conjunction with Flat Hammock Press, a new edition of &#34;Sinbad of the Coast Guard,&#34; the adventurous, true story of the USCGC Campbell&#39;s mascot whose exploits during World War II became legend. Appropriately, Sinbad&#39;s story was told by a fellow member of the Coast Guard, Chief George F. Foley, Jr., while the fine pictures were drawn by the outstanding Coast Guard Reserve artist, George Gray. In November 2008, his first novel Choke Points was published by Cutter Publishing. The plot centers on the real threats to US Maritime and Port Security. After graduating from Montclair State College, Walling served in the U.S. Coast Guard for six years as a commissioned officer and a senior petty officer. His assignments included buoy tending, search and rescue missions, drug law enforcement, and oceanographic operations in the Arctic. As part of the Boarding Party and Prize Crew teams on two cutters, he participated in the seizures of a Panamanian drug-runner and a Cuban fishing boat.

Willey describes early neo-Kantianism as a reaction of scientists and scientific philosophers against both the then discredited Hegelianism and Naturphilosophie of the preceding era and the simplistic and deterministic scientific materialism of the 1850s. "Back to Kant" was the slogan of a revolt against theories of knowledge which seemed inadequate to recent discoveries in thermodynamics, physiology, optics and other fields. Because Immanuel Kant was the philosopher who placed Newtonian physics on new epistemological foundations and demonstrated the possibility of universal scientific truth, he was the right thinker for a generation of scholars living through a new scientific revolution in Germany and dissatisfied with both speculative idealism and crude materialism. </p><p>The second wave of neo-Kantians continued to discuss problems of scientific epistemology in the 1880s and after, but they also showed a keen interest in political and social matters, attempting to bridge liberalism and socialism with Kantian ethics. </p><p>Neo-Kantians had to face questions of socialism, the place of the working class in society, the phenomenon of social welfare, the challenge of political democracy. Willey uses the biographical approach to develop the relationship between unity and diversity in the movement, and to underscore the importance of personality in history. While individual dissertations and monographs have been written on various thinkers and schools within neo-Kantianism, this is the first wide-ranging history of the entire phenomenon.</p><p>Willey observes that the movement did succeed in reasserting ethical values and in separating humanistic studies from the methods of physical science. He also discusses the possibility that a wider acceptance of neo-Kantian ideals among bourgeois intellectuals and socialist leaders might have reduced class antagonisms and sustained a stronger feeling of community between Germany and the West.</p></p><p>Back to Kant is a study of the rise of the neo-Kantian movement from its origins in the 1850s to its academic preeminence in the years before World War I.Thomas E. Willey, associate professor of history at McMaster University, has degrees from Butler University (B.A., 1959), and Yale University (M.A., and Ph.D., 1965).

Their plan was to seize control of key waterways and port cities, a move that would cripple America's defenses. Outnumbered and outgunned, the U. S. land and sea forces fought the British ships and troops to a standstill, allowing the leader of the American fleet, Lieutenant Thomas Macdonough, to carry out a brilliant maneuver which ensured an American victory. <br><br>Author Fitz-Enz researched and produced a companion PBS documentary that examined the leaders on both sides of the conflict and their actions during the battle. His research brought to light numerous documents, including diaries and secret battle orders, that reveal new insights into the battle. His descriptions of the confrontation in the pages of <i>The Final Invasion</i> bring to vivid life the cannon blasts that tore through ships and their crews and the rush of infantry storming the fortifications around the city. <br><br>Endorsed by the U. S. Army War College, <i>The Final Invasion</i> is a thrilling look at a pivotal moment in American and world history.</p><p>Colonel David G. Fitz-Enz was a regular U. S. Army officer for thirty years, who helped set up and maintain the White House-Moscow "hot line." He is also the author of <i>Why A Soldier?</i>.

(<i>Tulsa World</i>)<br><br><i>The Final Invasion</i> is a splendid account of one of the pivotal battles in American history. The books is thoroughly researched and beautifully told. Author Colonel Fitz-Enz relates, in exciting prose, this effort on the part of the British to recapture their priceless North American colonies lost in the Revolutionary War. The story of the battle between the English and American fleets on Lake Champlain in 1814 is a breathtaking blow-by-blow account, bringing out the horror of ship-to-ship encounters in that day. (Vice Admiral James F. Calvert, USN (ret.))<br><br>Colonel David Fitz-Enz has produced what will long stand as the standard account of one of the least known but most decisive military campaigns in American history. Though overshadowed by the burning of Washington, DC, and Jackson's defeat of the British at New Orleans, it was the 1814 campaign in upstate New York that determined the outcome of the War of 1812. During exhaustive research Fitz-Enz uncovered in Portugal a copy of orders sent to Sir George Prevost which lead to judgements much kinder to Sir George Prevost than those of many previous historians. Drawing on his experience as a soldier and a thorough understanding of the setting, both on land and of the nature of Lake Champlain, Fitz-Enz has produced a clear narrative that brings to life the people and events of September 1814 like never before. (James C. Bradford)<br><br>David Fitz-Enz has written a wonderful book on one of the more important but less well-known battles of our country. It tells a compelling story of how a few soldiers and sailors of our new nation defeated the best professionals of the British Army, fresh from defeating Napoleon. (John W. Foss, General of the U. S.

He was the co-editor of the famous Pulpit Commentary (this commentary is even larger than the Pulpit Commentary). This remarkable work is the triumph of a life devoted to Biblical research and study. Assisted by a small army of students, the Exell set draws on the rich stores of great minds since the beginning of New Testament times. -- The Biblical Illustrator brings Scripture to life in a unique, illuminating way. While other commentaries explain a Bible passage doctrinally, this work illustrates the Bible with a collection of illustrations of use, outlines, anecdotes, history, poems, expositions, geography, sermons, Bible backgrounds and homiletics for nearly every verse in the Bible. This massive commentary was originally intended for preachers needing help with sermon preparation. But today, the Biblical Illustrator provides life application, illumination, inspiration, doctrine, devotion, and practical content for all who teach, preach, and study the Bible. -- The Biblical Illustrator includes material from hundreds of famous authors of the day.</p><p></p><h2>Health, Wealth &amp; Happiness: Has the Prosperity Gospel Overshadowed the Gospel of Christ?</h2><p>The desire for a thriving, healthy, and productive life is as strong as ever, especially in tough economic times. As people become more disillusioned at the state of the economy, they also become more susceptible to the lure of the prosperity gospel and its teachings of health, wealth, and happiness for the faithful. But what happens when the promise of prosperity overshadows the promise of the real gospel--the gospel of Christ?<br>&nbsp;<br>Believing that the prosperity gospel is constructed upon faulty theology, authors David W. Jones and Russell S. Woodbridge take a closer look at five crucial areas of error relating to the prosperity gospel. In a fair but firm tone, the authors discuss the history and theology of the prosperity gospel movement to reveal its fraudulent core biblical teachings that have been historically and popularly misinterpreted, even by some of today's most well-known pastors. After an introduction and assessment of the movement, readers are invited to take a look at Scripture to understand what the Bible really says about wealth, poverty, suffering, and giving.<br><br>Theologically sound but acessible to all readers, <i>Health, Wealth &amp; Happiness</i> is sure to become a trusted resource for laypersons, pastors, and Christian leaders.</p><p>"The prosperity gospel is a false gospel, and prosperity preachers are false prophets.&nbsp; This book is as clear as that--and persuasive--but it is even more. Jones and Woodbridge have written a simple, careful account of the new religion that is sweeping Asia, Africa, and the Americas.&nbsp; And they've provided a fair, biblical and searching critique.&nbsp; I'm sad to say that this book is desperately needed; I'm thankful that it's now available."<br>- Mark Dever, Senior Pastor, Capitol Hill Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.<br><br>"The prosperity gospel is neither prosperous nor is it the gospel as defined by Scripture. Simply put, it is a false teaching and a dangerous heresy. This book written by two dear friends and superb biblical scholars carefully and accurately investigates, critiques, and exposes the biblical and theological errors that pervade this movement. This is an important and valuable work. I pray for its wide distribution and reading."&nbsp; <br>- Daniel L. Akin, President, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, Wake Forest, NC<br><br>"This book takes a balanced approach that is both biblically rigorous and in touch with current issues. This is an invaluable resource for those wishing to deal with the prosperity gospel with accuracy and clarity. This is a very Gospel-centered book."<br>- J. D. Greear, Lead Pastor of The Summit Church, Durham, NC.<br><br>"I praise God for the release of this book. It is a reliable resource for all who want to understand the destructive nature of the prosperity gospel movement. Jones and Woodbridge carefully point out its major biblical errors and call attention to the presence of erronious concepts found in prosperity theology. By exposing these errors, as well as interacting with some of the leading proponents of the prosperity movement, Jones and Woodbridge have provided a wonderful resource to hand to those who've bought into a counterfeit gospel, and for pastors who desire to protect their flock from wolves. May God use this book to direct people to the only true Gospel, and to the Savior, who is Himself our inheritance and our treasure."<br>- Tony Merida, Teaching Pastor at Temple Baptist Church, Hattiesburg, MS<br>"In this book Jones and Woodbridge have given us the truth about the prosperity gospel. This brief survey is remarkably clear and concise, providing both the historical background and biblical critique of this movement. Their treatment is fair and balanced, penetrating to the heart, and it reveals the danger of the prosperity gospel. I highly recommend this well written book."<br>- Benjamin L. Merkle, Associate Professor of New Testament at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, Wake Forest, NC<br>"This book is long overdue.&nbsp;The authors rightly warn us that the prosperity gospel has eclipsed the true message of the cross in many pulpits.&nbsp;Sadly, much of evangelicalism has been duped by a message that sounds biblical, but on closer examination is seen to be heretical.&nbsp;I pray that this book will help correct this error."<br>- Erwin W. Lutzer, Senior Pastor, The Moody Church, Chicago, IL<br>"In a work that is long overdue, Drs. Jones and Woodbridge deal the prosperity gospel a fatal blow through their thorough research and irrefutable documentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The authors, blending biblical theology with persuasive wit, create a rare blend that will appeal to both the layperson and theologian. Churches wrestling with the destructive doctrine of the prosperity gospel now have a staunch advocate and ready defense that clearly delineates God's will on such matters."&nbsp;- Emir Caner, best-selling author, President, Truett-McConnell College, Cleveland, GA<b>46% of self-identifying Christians believe God will make them rich if they have enough faith.</b><br><br>Every day on radio or TV there's a new gospel being proclaimed--the gospel of prosperity. This gospel teaches that God wants to fulfill our every desire for health, wealth, and happiness, and all it takes is enough faith. The preachers of prosperity tout their own opulent lifestyles as proof of their message: God wants his children to have it all. Is this the gospel? Or is it just a feel-good, self-centered appeal to our materialistic impulses that omits the message of Jesus and the cross?<br><br>The Bible does have a lot to say about wealth and possessions, but those teachings are routinely twisted out of context or carelessly misinterpreted. Authors David W. Jones and Russell S. Woodbridge go back to the Scriptures to set forth a truly biblical understanding of wealth, poverty, suffering, and giving. They identify five crucial areas of error related to the prosperity gospel movement and challenge readers to rediscover the true gospel of Jesus.</p><h2>Right in Her Soul: The Life of Anna Louise Strong</h2><p>Provides an intimate portrait of the twentieth-century American &#34;Reds&#34; journalist, who became involved in the Chinese and Russian Revolutions and with such key personages as Trotsky and Mao</p><p></p><h2>Borrower of the Night</h2><p>A treasure hunt in an old German castle leads Vicky Bliss on a dangerous search for a long-lost Gothic shrine carved by the great German sculptor Tilman Riemanschneider</p><p>ELIZABETH PETERS, whose New York Times best-selling novels are often set against historical backdrops, earned a Ph.D. in Egyptology at the University of Chicago.

Michele Hernandez, on the other hand, is the ultimate insider. A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Dartmouth College, she also worked as Dartmouth's assistant director of admissions for four years. In <i>A Is for Admissions</i>, Hernandez describes the step-by-step process Ivy League schools use to evaluate an application. Along the way she settles some ancient debates, including the comparative importance of SATs versus high-school grades, public versus private high schools, and extracurricular activities versus part-time employment. She evaluates every possible factor affecting chances for admission, including special categories of students such as recruited athletes, minority applicants, and legacies. Most dramatically, Hernandez reveals the precise mathematical formula used by admissions officers to rank applicants. Using her guidelines, readers can calculate their own AI (Academic Index) and--should their scores come up short--learn ways to compensate in other areas. <p> Refreshingly, Hernandez helps would-be Ivy Leaguers keep their goals in perspective. She strongly advises against "grade grubbing" or "working for the grade." If you think attending a top college is the key to success, Hernandez cautions that the Ivies may not be for you. "If your goal is to make money, but you don't enjoy studying or reading, don't waste your time by trying to get into an Ivy League or highly selective college.... The beauty of an Ivy League/highly selective education lies in the intellectual atmosphere.... It does not lie in the prestige of having a diploma from Princeton or Dartmouth on your wall." Levelheaded and clearly written, <i>A Is for Admission</i> is the perfect guide for the student (or parent) who has his eyes set on the stars.</p>Michele A.

My scenario also posits a higher global average temperature for 2045 than the bulk of the models predict, but 2.8 degrees Celsius higher by that date is within the range of possibility, especially if some of the positive feedback mechanisms, such as the partial failure of the oceanic carbon sinks, the melting of the permafrost, and an ice-free Arctic Ocean in the summertime, begin to operate within this period. Unhappily, recent data from the tropical oceans, the permafrost belt and the Arctic Ocean suggest that all these feedbacks may be starting to kick in now, much earlier than expected. <br> <br>The scenario also assumes that the governments of the planet will not have taken advantage of the twenty-year window of opportunity that we still have to get global emissions of greenhouse gases down by 80 percent. It assumes that mid-century will see the world on the upper path of global heating, with the planet&#x2019;s average temperature already two or three degrees Celsius hotter and heading for eight, nine or ten degrees hotter by century&#x2019;s end. In this world, our worries are not just hotter summers, bigger hurricanes, rising sea levels and polar bears swimming for their lives. We are trying to avoid megadeaths from mass starvation and, quite possibly, from nuclear wars &#x2013; and the odds aren&#x2019;t good. <br> <br>This is a world in which food imports are no longer available at any price, as there is a global food shortage. But there are still relative winners and relative losers: the higher-latitude countries &#x2013; northern Europe, Russia, Canada &#x2013; are still getting adequate rainfall and are able to feed themselves, while those in the mid-latitudes are in serious trouble. Even the United States has lost a large amount of its crop-growing area as the rain fails to fall over the high plains west of the Mississippi, persistent droughts beset the southeast, and the rivers that provided irrigation water for the Central Valley of California cease to flow in the summertime. Countries of smaller size, like Spain, Italy and Turkey on the northern side of the Mediterranean (not to mention those on the southern side), find that their entire land area is turning into desert and that they can no longer feed their populations. The northeastern monsoon that brought rain to the north Chinese plain has failed, and the rivers that watered southern China have suffered the same fate as those that provided California&#x2019;s water: now they only flow in the wintertime. <br> <br>This is a world where people are starting to starve, but it is not always the familiar scene of helpless peasant societies facing famine with numb resignation. Some of the victims now are fully developed, technologically competent countries, and their people will not watch their children starve so long as there is any recourse, however illegitimate, that might save them. So the lucky countries in the northern tier that can still feed themselves &#x2013; but have little or no food to spare &#x2013; must be able to turn back hordes of hungry refugees, quite probably by force. They must also be able to deal with neighbours who try to extort food by threats &#x2013; and these desperate neighbours may even have nuclear weapons. Appeals to reason will be pointless, as it is reasonable for nations to do anything they can to avoid mass starvation. <br> <br>If the climate modellers will not generate this kind of scenario, who will? The military, of course. <br> <br>The military profession, especially in the long-established great powers, is deeply pessimistic about the likelihood that people and countries will behave well under stress. Professional officers are trained to think in terms of emergent threats, and this is as big a threat as you are going to find. Never mind what the pundits are telling the public about the perils of climate change; what are the military strategists telling their governments? That will tell us a great deal about the probable shape of the future, although it may not tell us anything that we want to hear. <br> <br>In Britain, climate change has been taken seriously at the official level for a long time, and the British Armed Forces are free to discuss any scenarios they want. The <i>DCDC Global Strategic Trends Programme 2007&#x2014;2036, </i>third edition, 2006, a ninety-one-page document produced by the Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre within the British Ministry of Defence and regularly updated online, is &#x201c;a source document for the development of UK Defence Policy.&#x201d; <br> <br>In many ways, it is a remarkably sophisticated document. At one point, for example, it observes that &#x201c;by the end of the period [2036] it is likely that the majority of the global population will find it difficult to &#x2018;turn the outside world off.&#x2019; ICT [information and communication technology] is likely to be so pervasive that people are permanently connected to a network or two-way data stream with inherent challenges to civil liberties; being disconnected could be considered suspicious.&#x201d; But on the political and strategic impacts of climate change, it is surprisingly terse. Here is all it has to say on the matter: <br> <br> <i>The future effects of climate change will stem from a more unstable process, involving sudden and possibly in some cases catastrophic changes. It is possible that the effects will be felt more rapidly and widely than anticipated, leading, for example, to an unexpected increase in extreme weather events, challenging the individual and collective capacity to respond . . .<br><br>Increasing demand and climate change are likely to place pressure on the supply of key staples, for example, a drastic depletion of fish stocks or a significantly reduced capacity to grow rice in SE Asia or wheat on the US plains. A succession of poor harvests may cause a major price spike, resulting in significant economic and political turbulence, as well as humanitarian crises of significant proportions and frequency . . .<br><br>Water stress will increase, with the risk that disputes over water will contribute significantly to tensions in already volatile regions, possibly triggering military action and population movements . . . Areas most at risk are in North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, including China whose growing problems of water scarcity and contamination may lead it to attempt to re-route the waters of rivers flowing into neighbouring India, such as the Brahmaputra . . .<br><br>A combination of resource pressure, climate change and the pursuit of economic advantage may stimulate rapid large-scale shifts in population. In particular, sub-Saharan populations will be drawn towards the Mediterranean, Europe and the Middle East, while in Southern Asia coastal inundation, environmental pressure on land and acute economic competition will affect large populations in Bangladesh and on the East coast of India. Similar effects may be felt in the major East Asian archipelagos, while low-lying islands may become uninhabitable.<br></i> <br>There now, that wasn&#x2019;t so bad, was it? A shortage of fish here, a major price spike in food there, a little border war between China and India over re-routing the rivers, and a few tens of millions of climate refugees heading north out of sub-Saharan Africa and Bangladesh. If that&#x2019;s the sum of the damage climate change that will bring in the next thirty years, we can live with that. <br> <br>Unfortunately, that isn&#x2019;t the end of it. This exercise in future-gazing only takes us out to 2036, not to 2045. Far more importantly, it is dated December 2006, which means that the climate forecasts it is using come from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&#x2019;s 2001 report, not its 2007 report. Essentially, the data it is using are on average close to ten years old. That makes a big difference, because the data and the forecasts have been getting steadily worse. The next iteration of the DCDC report will at least refer to the 2007 IPCC report (although that is already seriously out of date, too), and is likely to feature much darker scenarios on the climate-change front. <br> <br>So, if the British Armed Forces aren&#x2019;t producing up-to-date scenarios about the political and strategic impacts of climate change, who is? The American military? But here we have the problem that the U.S. government, from the inauguration of President George W. Bush in January 2001 until sometime in late 2006, was in complete denial about climate change. In subsequent months the phrase &#x201c;climate change&#x201d; was finally heard to pass the president&#x2019;s lips unaccompanied by disparaging remarks several times, so, in late March 2007, the U.S. Army War College sponsored a two-day conference on &#x201c;The National Security Implications of Climate Change,&#x201d; at which civilian strategists and active duty and retired officers explored a wide range of climate-related security issues. It seems clear that the military had been chafing at the bit for some time previously, however, since the following month saw the publication of a study that had been in the works for at least two years. At the time when it was commissioned, no bureaucratic warrior experienced in Washington&#x2019;s ways would have risked putting his or her name on a study of the geopolitics of climate change, so the Pentagon farmed the job out to the CNA Corporation. <br> <br> <i>I have long been interested in and concerned about how environment affects security, and I spent eight years at the Department of Defense with that portfolio, environmental security. I was approached by a group of foundations several years ago and asked specifically if I would examine the national security implications of climate change, and for that purpose I assembled the Military Advisory Board of retired three- and four-star generals to assist us in that effort.<br><br>In our report, we were looking primarily over the next thirty to forty years. There are certainly disruptive events that could potentially occur earlier. An extreme weather event, or multiple extreme weather events, could occur at any time. But the more significant implications probably occur over the next several decades, and then of course far into the future. Unless we begin to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and change the way we use energy, we really have some frightening futures.<br></i> <br>&#x2013;Sherri Goodman, general counsel, CNA Corporation, in an interview with the author, February 4, 2008 <br> <br>The CNA Corporation is actually the old Center for Naval Analyses, descended from the group of scientists who brought the fledgling methodology of &#x201c;operational research&#x201d; to bear on the problem of anti-submarine warfare during the Second World War, and subsequently on other problems of naval strategy and tactics as well. It is now described as &#x201c;a federally funded research and development center serving the Department of the Navy and other defense agencies.&#x201d; It produced its report, <i>National Security and Climate Change, </i>in April 2007. <br> <br>The exercise involved choosing eleven recently retired three- and four- star generals and admirals from all four services, exposing them to the views of a large number of people working on climate change or related fields, and then writing a study on which the retired military men were asked to comment and elaborate. It created quite a stir when it was published, precisely because it effectively circumvented the Bush ban on treating climate change as a real and serious phenomenon. <br> <br> <i>You already have great tension over water [in the Middle East]. These are cultures often built around a single source of water. So any stresses on the rivers and aquifers can be a source of conflict. If you consider land loss, the Nile Delta region is the most fertile ground in Egypt. Any losses there [from a storm surge] could cause a real problem, again because the region is so fragile . . .<br><br>We will pay for this one way or another. We will pay to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions today, and we&#x2019;ll have to take an economic hit of some kind. Or we will pay the price later in military terms. And that will involve human lives. There will be a human toll. There is no way out of this that does not have real costs attached to it.<br></i> <br>&#x2013;General Anthony C. &#x201c;Tony&#x201d; Zinni, USMC (Ret.), former commander in chief, U.S. Central Command, <i>National Security and Climate Change, </i>April 2007 <br> <br>The <i>National Security and Climate Change </i>study is sixty-two pages long and very well sourced, but it doesn&#x2019;t really offer scenarios. It covers all the bad things that may happen if global warming progresses past a certain point, region by region, but it doesn&#x2019;t even specify what that point is. Indeed, it resembles a more concise version of all the books that have been published by various luminaries over the past couple of years rehearsing all the undesirable things that will happen to us if we don&#x2019;t pull our socks up and deal with global warming: a dab of science, a shopping list of small and large disasters in no particular order (not even in a likely time sequence), and a good deal of exhortation to take this seriously. <br> <br>The real point of the exercise was probably to persuade a largely military audience of the importance of climate change by having the retired generals and admirals give it their imprimatur. A panel of experts wrote the actual report, but the senior officers were each given an entire page to express their views on the contents and the topic &#x2013; and it is their testimony that is the heart of the matter. They are intelligent men of considerable experience, so they offer coherent and convincing testimony. But they are clearly selling something. <br> <br> <i>People are saying they want to be convinced, perfectly. They want to know the climate science projections with 100 percent certainty. Well, we know a great deal, and even with that, there is still uncertainty. But the trend line is very clear. We never have 100 percent certainty. We never have it. If you wait till you have 100 percent certainty, something bad is going to happen on the battlefield. That&#x2019;s something we know. You have to act with incomplete information. You have to act based on the trend line . . .<br><br>The situation, for much of the Cold War, was stable. And the challenge was to keep it stable, to stop the catastrophic event from happening. We spent billions on that strategy. Climate change is exactly the opposite. We have a catastrophic event that appears to be inevitable. And the challenge is to stabilize things &#x2013; to stabilize carbon in the atmosphere. Back then, the challenge was to stop a particular action. Now, the challenge is to inspire a particular action. We have to act if we&#x2019;re to avoid the worst effects.<br></i> <br>&#x2013;General Gordon R. Sullivan, USA (Ret.), former chief of staff, U.S. Army, <i>National Security and Climate Change, </i>April 2007 <br> <br>What they are selling is a mission. The next mission of the U.S. Armed Forces is going to be the long struggle to maintain stability as climate change continually undermines it. The &#x201c;war on terror&#x201d; has more or less had its day, and besides, climate change is a real, full-spectrum challenge that may require everything from special forces to aircraft carriers. So it&#x2019;s time to jolt the rank and file of the officer corps out of their complacency, re-orient them towards the new threat, and get them moving.</p><h2>The Vivisector (20th Century Classics)</h2><p>Hurtle Duffield is incapable of loving anything except his art.

The American West is untamed, uncivilized, and largely unclaimed. U.S. President Andrew Jackson, in a race with the British and Russians, sends a wagon train of would-be settlers into the uncharted Oregon territory, led by his close friend, mountain man and veteran Sam Brentwood. Teaming up with trail hand Whip Holt, widow Claudia Humphries, and a colorful group of courageous pioneers, Brentwood sets off from New York, heading westward to Independence, Missouri&#x2014;the last outpost of civilization before the unknown and treacherous dangers of a new frontier. Along the way they will form unbreakable friendships, fight unforeseen enemies, and face unimaginable and often fatal odds. But in spite of the hardships and heartaches, the tragedies and triumphs, they will risk their lives to follow their dreams&#x2014;and forge a nation&#x2019;s destiny. This is their story.</p><p>Dana Fuller Ross was the pseudonym of Noel Bertram Gerson. Gerson, a prolific writer, wrote numerous works under many pseudonyms including the White Indian novels, which he wrote as Donald Clayton Porter.Independence! is a 70mm wide-screen sort of novel with a cast of thousands and lots of familiar faces in the leading roles. It&#39;s all a little larger than life and much neater, but a good yarn. Reader Tom Morgan plunges into this epic with assurance in a light, pleasant voice well-suited to prolonged listening. His character voices are lightly drawn but consistent enough for clarity, and he commands a wide range of regional accents. He makes little effort to differentiate female voices as such, but that&#39;s a minor quibble. Neat packaging and production wrap up an attractive selection for light listening. J.N.

The culture of confession has given rise to novels that begin with an unspeakable act (graphically described) and end in redemption (this part is usually more vague). That's not how it works in J.L. Carr's quiet, brief, dreamy <i>A Month in the Country</i>. Writing in 1978, Carr's narrator, Tom Birkin, recalls the summer of 1920. A veteran of the Great War and a cuckold, Tom arrives in Oxgodby to restore a medieval mural in the church. His single season in this town in the north of England passes quickly: he sleeps in the belfry, makes a friend or two, falls secretly in love with the vicar's wife, and, chipping away at plaster and dirt, uncovers a lost masterpiece. These events seem to melt past Tom in the heat of the perfect, fleeting English summer: "The front gardens of cottages were crammed with marjoram and roses, marguerites, sweet William, at night heavy with the scent of stocks. The Vale was heavy with leaves, motionless in the early morning, black caves of shadow in the midday heat, blurring the sound of trains hammering north and south." <p> Carr devotes many fewer words to Tom's time in the war. The vicar's wife tries to ask him about it. "'What about hell on earth?' she said. I told her I'd seen it and lived there and that, mercifully, they usually left an exit open." His healing consists of not talking about his past--perhaps a revolutionary notion these days. <i>A Month in the Country</i>, with its paean to a lost, good place, oddly recalls Alain-Fournier's <i>Le Grand Meaulnes</i>. But where that novel was elliptical, Carr's work values clarity and simplicity above all. These are rare enough qualities, but to find them in a novel of romance and healing is a rarer pleasure still. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>James Lloyd Carr was born in 1912 and attended the village school at Carlton Miniott in Yorkshire.

Subversive, eccentric and flamboyant - the Bohemians ate garlic and didn&#39;t always wash; they painted and danced and didn&#39;t care what people thought. They sent their children to co-ed schools; explored homosexuality and Free Love. They were often drunk, broke and hungry but they were rebels. In this fascinating book Virginia Nicholson examines the way the Bohemians refashioned the way we live our lives. &#39;Interesting, gorgeous, wonderful.... this book displays the best of bohemia itself - playful, dazzling, original&#39; Julie Burchill, Spectator &#39;Racy, vivacious, warm-hearted. Offers an illuminating and well-researched portrait of life among the artists, a century ago&#39; TLS Virginia Nicholson was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. She has worked as a documentary researcher for BBC Television and her first book, Charleston - A Bloomsbury House and Garden (written in collaboration with her father, Quentin Bell), was an account of the Sussex home of her grandmother, the painter Vanessa Bell. Her second book, Among the Bohemians: Experiments in Living 1900-1939, was published by Penguin in 2002. She lives in Sussex.</p><p>Virginia Nicholson was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and grew up in Yorkshire and Sussex. She studied at Cambridge University and lived abroad in France and Italy, then worked as a documentary researcher for BBC Television. Her books include the acclaimed social histories Among the Bohemians: Experiments in Living 1900-1939, Singled Out: How Two Million Women Survived Without Men after the First World War, and Millions Like Us: Women&#39;s Lives During the Second World War, all published by Penguin. She is married to a writer, has three children and lives in Sussex.Nicholson, granddaughter of painter Vanessa Bell and great-niece of Virginia Woolf, is uniquely qualified to write about the experimental lifestyle of her grandparents' generation. The early 20th-century British bohemians-Bloomsbury and their extended circles, and lesser-known rebels like Roy Campbell and Jacob Epstein-rejected bourgeois Victorian values and embraced life as art, open marriage, Rousseau-influenced education and even poverty. Perhaps because she is an insider (despite having been born well after its heyday), Nicholson is able to communicate the ideals and desires of this generation without romanticizing it. The exhilaration of the bohemians' freedom and the hardships of the poverty in which many chose to live are equally portrayed. Their children place a golden haze on their youth but also blame their parents for not providing a rigorous education and a few rules to guide their way. The reader could also easily get impatient with how these talented individuals seemed determined to destroy themselves (the epilogue in particular reads like a catalogue of lives left ravaged by passions), but Nicholson effectively argues that theirs was the energy of true rebellion and implies that the excess was necessary to break with the constricting bonds of the past-and that the circle of bohemia ultimately changed how we all live. Although this account is written in a neutral, almost dry style as Nicholson examines the bohemians' daily lives thematically (sexual freedom, child-rearing, styles in clothing and interior decoration, etc.), the intimate conversations and salacious details related still titillate like gossip. Readers interested in the art, literature and personalities of this era will not be disappointed. B&amp;w photos, illus. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Begin a dialogue with the angels and you can achieve, in a practical way, the fultilling life you want and deserve.</p><p>In <i>Divine Prescriptions</i>, bestselling author Dr. Doreen Virtue illuminates the ways all of us can receive healing messages from God and the guardian angels when we need guidance. The angels will speak to us about health, family, relationships, finances, and careers, and<i> Divine Prescriptions</i> proves that fact citing case studies, angel readings, and transcripts from Dr. Virtue's angel therapy sessions. When the problems we face are too complex to be solved by counselors, friends, or even Dear Abby, Dr. Virtue shows us another way&#x2015;a divine way&#x2015;to discover answers.</p><p><i>Divine Prescriptions </i>also explains how and why God and our guardian angels use us as messengers to give advice and consolation to others. She explains how to distinguish between normal conversations and key messages from the angels (who are constantly around us) and provides step-by-step instructions for performing angel readings. Dr. Virtue's universe is benign, the angels around us mean us well, and once we are able to receive their vitally important communications our goals and those of the people we love will become attainable.</p></p><p><p><b>Doreen Virtue</b> holds a Ph.D. in counseling psychology and is a fourth generation metaphysician. She gives Divine Guidance workshops and lectures across the country and has written almost a dozen books on angel therapy.</p>Virtue believes that angels deliver healing messages from God to each of us. In a practical approach she describes how divine communication can range from solutions to family, health, and financial problems to more simple solutions, such as finding a parking spot. Virtue receives and delivers these messages to her patients, a capability she possessed even as a child. In a soothing and serene tone, she describes how continuous communication with personal angels is essential to developing conscious relationships with momentous results. If the step-by-step instructions to message recognition provided in this book are followed daily, Virtue believes, miracles will bless each person.

It secured the cartoonist&#x2019;s place as one of his generation&#x2019;s most skillful and ambitious practitioners, and proved a harbinger of the subject matter that the artist would go on to explore most consistently in later work: the nuclear family.</p><p><em>Mother, Come Home</em> quietly studies the inner lives of recently widowed David and his 7-year-old son, Thomas; both are unable to deal with their grief directly. Thomas, protected by a lion&#x2019;s mask that his mother gave him, constructs an identity for himself as &#x201c;the groundskeeper&#x201d;: ritual and routine, already important to children that age, become paramount to him. He struggles desperately to keep up appearances while his father, a professor of symbolic logic, becomes lost in abstractions. Father and son begin to retreat into their fantasies, but only one emerges.</p><p><em>Mother, Come Home</em> is masterfully drawn: Eisner-, Harvey-, and Ignatz-Award-nominated Hornschemeier&#x2019;s controlled brushwork is clean, and his nine-panel page layouts pace David&#x2019;s inexorable descent into utter despair. Hornschemeier is equally precise when it comes to <em>Mother, Come Home</em>&#x2019;s color palette: subdued but warm, which suits the story&#x2019;s melancholy and contemplative mode. <em>Mother, Come Home</em> is a powerful work with universal themes of anguish and loss.</p></p><p>Paul Hornschemeier lives in Chicago, IL, with his fiancï¿½e, Emily. He is the author of several graphic novels, including Mother, Come Home, Let Us Be Perfectly Clear, The Three Paradoxes, All and Sundry and Forlorn Funnies.Adult/High School&#x2013;Collecting two issues of Hornschemeier's "Forlorn Funnies" series, <i>Mother, Come Home</i> is a stand-alone retrospective tale of family tragedy told by Thomas Tennant, who lost his mother to cancer when he was seven. The story opens after her death, with his professor father struggling to maintain some sense of comfort and equilibrium for himself and his son. Thomas, occasionally donning a superhero cape and lion mask, fights to keep things together by cleaning up after his father, lying to the college when his dad misses yet another class, and tending his mother's garden. Needing more help than his son can provide, the father checks himself into residential care. Forced to move in with an uncle and aunt, Thomas copes by entering a bright, cartoonish fantasy world where everything is how he wants it. His fantasies drive the heart-wrenching climax when he "rescues" his father from the care center. The simplified forms and muted earth tones of the artwork alongside dark and serious themes create links to Chris Ware's <i>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth</i> (Pantheon, 2000), but Hornschemeier wields that rare gift of layered subtlety. Be it an almost imperceptible change in facial expressions or the slow death of a flower, he says significant, moving things in a few panels that would take pages to convey in a novel. But the book's greatest strength is the story itself and the lessons it offers for life, loss, and, most importantly, how to move on.<i>&#x2013;Matthew L.

Original.</p><p>Retired FBI agent Gregor Demarkian, last seen in Haddam's Halloween mystery, Quoth the Raven , takes on a new and engrossing murder case in time for St. Patrick's Day. Duty in the form of an anxious John Cardinal O'Bannion beckons Demarkian to Maryville, N.Y., where aspiring nun Brigit Ann Reilly has been found dead during a furious rainstorm, her corpse covered with water moccasins. Demarkian's expertise with poison is put to use as he determines that Brigit's death was caused by hemlock rather than snakebite and that the snakes were merely snuggling up to her body for warmth; however, he is perplexed because water moccasins are not indigenous to the North. Suspicion falls upon the owners of local menageries--Sam Harrigan, an actor who escapes media attention by living in Maryville, and Josh Malley, the restless 25-year-old kept man of 62-year-old bank owner Miriam Bailey. Josh's affair with a younger woman, a glitch in the bank's computer system, a threatening letter sent to the motherhouse of the Sisters of Divine Grace and the victim's melodramatic affection for secretive people all come into play in this lucid and enjoyable yarn. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>But Seriously: An Autobiography</h2><p>Once the all-conquering bad boy of tennis, John McEnroe is increasingly better known for his insightful commentaries and opinions on the game.

It is only in America that an immigrant could create a new life. Only in America could someone arrive speaking fewer than fifty words of English and work through the ranks to become the CEO of a major company. This someone is Paul Oreffice and this is his story--the American story.<br> <p>It begins in Italy, 1939. Mussolini is in power, and fascism is the rule of the day. Paul's father has not come home for twelve days, and his mother anticipates the worst. In fact, the fascist police have severely beaten Paul's father and thrown him in a tiny cell. For the sake of his family, Paul's father wins the heart of one of his jailers, who places an anonymous call to Paul's mother, relaying, "Your husband is alive." <br> </p><p>Thus begins the adventure that brings Paul and his family to America by way of Switzerland first and then Ecuador, escaping to that country only eight days before Italy enters World War II. Once in America, he enrolls at Purdue University though he knew almost no English. After graduating and serving for two years in the US Army during the Korean War, Paul rises rapidly through The Dow Chemical Companys ranks, helping it go from a domestic company to an international powerhouse through his roles as CEO, president, and chairman.<br> </p><p>Only in America weaves the story of Paul's immigration to America, revealing how difficult early experiences sharpened him and molded his outlook on management and life. He gives practical business advice--from someone who has been there--on how anyone, especially an immigrant, can seize the abundant opportunities this country offers, converting obstacles and setbacks into achievements and success.</p></p><p>Paul Oreffice became a great American business leader by first becoming a great American citizen and patriot. His story, told here with his customary brio, shows how the free enterprise system provides opportunity to talented and determined people whatever their origin and how it puts their talents to work on behalf of social welfare and prosperity.<br> <b>DICK CHENEY</b><br> <p><i>Only in America</i> is the story of the Land of Opportunity and of an immigrant boy who made the most of it. Paul Oreffice is an American original, and his account of his rise to the pinnacle of business leadership is filled with drama, inspiration, and wisdom.<br> <b>GERALD FORD</b> <i>38th President of the United States</i><br> </p><p>Paul Oreffice's remarkable tale of turning insurmountable obstacles into triumphs again and again is nothing short of inspiring.<br> <b>NEWT GINGRICH</b> <i>Former Speaker of the House of Representatives</i><br> </p><p>I have been an unabashed fan of Paul Oreffice for many years. As I have told everyone, he represents the best of what an American CEO is all about.<br> <b>JACK WELCH</b> <i>Retired CEO, General Electric</i><br> </p><p>Paul Oreffice affirms that the American dream is alive and well. You won't be able to put it down.<br> <b>PETER UEBERROTH</b> <i>Former Commissioner of Major League Baseball</i><br> </p><p>Paul Oreffice is the Vince Lombardi of the business world.<br> <b>WILLIE DAVIS</b> <i>Member NFL Hall of Fame</i><br> </p><p><i>Only in America</i> is a must read for all immigrants who wish to succeed in this country. Paul Oreffice's journey from Venice, Italy, to CEO of one of the world's greatest corporations is proof that an immigrant can make it to the top. If, like Oreffice, newcomers learn English, get a good education, set goals, and work with determination, they too will succeed. America loves winners, especially those who succeed the old-fashioned way by working harder and smarter than their competitors.<br> <b>DEXTER BAKER</b> <i>Former Chairman, National Assn. of Manufacturers and Air Products and Chemicals</i></p>PAUL OREFFICE was born in Venice, Italy, in 1927. In 1940 he moved with his family to Quito, Ecuador, and in 1945 came to the USA. He went directly to Purdue University where he graduated in February 1949 with a BS in Chemical Engineering.After two years in the US Army, Paul joined The Dow Chemical Company in February 1953. After a variety of international and management assignments, he became the president and CEO of the company in April 1978. He later added the title of chairman of the board. He retired in December 1992.Paul has served on the boards of CIGNA, Coca-Cola, Morgan Stanley, and Nortel. He is currently the chairman of Fairfield Homes and is on the board of Spirit Finance Corporation. He is also the chairman of The National Parkinson Foundation and on the visiting board of MD Anderson Cancer Center.

Fossey&#39;s extraordinary efforts to ensure the future of the rain forest and its remaining mountain gorillas are captured in her own words and in candid photographs of this fascinating endangered species. As only she could, Fossey combined her personal adventure story with groundbreaking scientific reporting in an unforgettable portrait of one of our closest primate relatives. Although Fossey&#39;s work ended tragically in her murder, GORILLAS IN THE MIST remains an invaluable testament to one of the longest-running field studies of primates and reveals her undying passion for her subject.</p><p>In 1963, an occupational therapist from Kentucky, in uncertain health and spirits, traveled to central Africa in the quixotic hope of seeing a mountain gorilla in its natural habitat. Dian Fossey had read everything she could about the reclusive and much-feared animal, and she returned from her trip convinced that most of the books were wrong.<p> During her seven-week stay in Africa, Fossey had a chance encounter with the famed primatologists Mary and Louis Leakey, who encouraged her to follow her dream of living among the mountain gorillas and learning their ways. In 1967 she did just that, setting up a camp on the slopes of the 14,000-foot Virunga Volcanoes of Rwanda and studying four gorilla families there. Although it took them some time to accept Fossey's presence among them, she was immediately impressed by their peaceful nature and by their generous, guileless behavior--so unlike the images found in popular culture.</p><p> But, Fossey discovered, despite their peaceable way of life, the gorillas had many enemies in the form of poachers who hunted them for their hands, skins, and heads--ghastly remains sold to the tourist market. Much of Fossey's thoughtful but often rightly angry memoir <i>Gorillas in the Mist</i> is a well-reasoned plea for the protection of the gorillas and the suppression of the poachers' black market. That argument found a wide audience when her book was published in 1983, but Fossey's work remains unfinished: she was murdered, probably by those very poachers, in 1985, and today there are fewer than 650 mountain gorillas in the wild. To read <i>Gorillas in the Mist</i> is a first step for anyone concerned with their preservation, and that of other wild species everywhere. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>No Bio</p><h2>Phule Me Twice (Phule&#39;s Company)</h2><p>When the planet Zenobia is invaded, Captain Willard Phule takes on the job of military advisor to the peaceful dinosaurlike Zenobians, but his mission is complicated when a robot double of Phule mysteriously appears out of nowhere.

As the boys grow older, Kristin is increasingly worried about their prospects, and she and Erlend become estranged. The most devastating and emotional volume in the trilogy, The Cross chronicles the trials and losses Kristin must bear, and how she finds the strength to endure them. This final chapter in her story emphasized the medieval belief that the spiritual world has primacy over the material one, a belief with which Undset herself concurred but found lacking in most of her own contemporaries.</p><p>e of this great and popular work, Kristin rearranges her life after the Black Death has devastated her world.<b>Sigrid Undset</b> (1882-1949) was born in Denmark, the eldest daughter of a Norwegian father and a Danish mother. Two years after her birth, the family moved to Oslo, where her father, a distinguished archaeologist, taught at the university. Her father's interest in the past had a tremendous influence on Undset. She was particularly entranced by the dramatic Old Norse sagas she read as a child, later declaring that her exposure to them marked "the most important turning point in my life."<p>Undset's first published works&#x2014;the novel <b>Mrs. Marta Oulie </b>(1907) and a short-story collection <b>The Happy Age</b> (1908)&#x2014;were set in contemporary times and achieved both critical and popular success. With her reputation as a writer well-established, Undset had the freedom to explore the world that had first fired her imagination, and in <b>Gunnar's Daughter</b> (1909) she drew upon her knowledge of Norway's history and legends, including the Icelandic Sagas, to recreate medieval life with compelling immediacy. In 1912 Undset married the painter Anders Castus Svarstad and over the next ten years faced the formidable challenge of raising three stepchildren and her own three off-spring with little financial or emotional support from her husband. Eventually, she and her children moved from Oslo to Lillehammer, and her marriage was annulled in 1924, when Undset converted to Catholicism.</p><p>Although Undset wrote more modern novels, a collection of essays on feminism, as well as numerous book reviews and newspaper articles, her fascination with the Middle Ages never ebbed, and in 1920 she published <b>The Wreath</b>, the first volume of her most famous work, <b>Kristin Lavransdatter</b>. The next two volumes quickly followed&#x2014;<b>The Wife</b> in 1921, and <b>The Cross</b> in 1922. The trilogy earned Undset worldwide acclaim, and her second great medieval epic&#x2014;the four-volume <b>The Master of Hestviken</b> (1925-1927) &#x2014;confirmed her place as one of the twentieth century's greatest writers. In 1928, at the age of 46, she received the Nobel Prize for Literature, only the third woman to be so honored.</p><p>Undset went on to publish more novels&#x2014;including the autobiographical <b>The Longest Years</b>&#x2014;and several collections of essays during the 1930s. As the Germans advanced through Norway in 1940, Undset, an outspoken critic of Nazism, fled the country and eventually settled in Brooklyn, New York. She returned to her homeland in 1945, and two years later she was awarded Norway's highest honor for her "distinguished literary work and for service to her country." The years of exile, however, had taken a great toll on her, and she died of a stroke on June 10, 1949.</p></p><h2>The Tale of Jeremy Vole (Riverbank Stories No. 1)</h2><p>Jeremy Vole&#39;s peaceful life on the canal is disrupted by the warning he receives from a Great Blue Heron that the worst flood in one hundred years is on its way</p><p>Stephen Lawhead&#x2019;s <b><i>Riverbank Stories</i></b> are absorbing adventures, with timeless lessons, for all young animal lovers.

In the next fifteen years, three of those founding Fairportees Richard Thompson, Ashley 'Tyger' Hutchings and Simon Nicol along with the next generation of Fairport recruits - Iain Matthews, Sandy Denny, and the three Daves: Swarbrick, Pegg and Mattacks - would form a veritable dynasty of English folk-rock, each pursuing their own path, but always returning to work with each other, to collectively produce albums with a near-eternal appeal.<br><br> Which is why every year since 1979 in a field somewhere near Banbury, 20,000-plus fans have congregated to celebrate this music's enduring appeal at the Cropredy Festival.<br><br> So, fifty years on, now seems like the right time to tell the full story: to collect all the family lore that surrounds Fairport and its surrogates, and to disentangle the many highs and lows from those first fifteen years of Fotheringport Confusion.<br><br> Drawing on interviews with all the musicians and key figures in English folk-rock - including producers extraordinaire Joe Boyd and Sandy Roberton - Clinton Heylin has produced the definitive history of a folk-rock family in its golden era.</p><p></p><h2>Draw-It Dragons (LOVE TO DRAW)</h2><p>Teaches how to draw Toothless, Hookfang, Meatlug, and other dragons from the film &#34;How to Train Your Dragon 2,&#34; and includes sticker games, mazes, and drawing activities.</p><p></p><h2>One Frog Too Many (Boy, Dog, Frog)</h2><p>A boy&#39;s pet frog thinks that the new little frog the boy gets for his birthday is one frog too many.</p><p>Mercer Mayer began writing and illustrating children's books in 1966, and since that time, he has published over 300 titles.

As the festivities unfold (and the cash bar opens), everyone has an opinion and a lively prediction about April and Caleb's union, each the reflection of a different marital experience.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the nearby Hideaway Lodge, a domestic quarrel ends in tragedy. As April and Caleb's life together begins, death parts another man and woman in angry violence&#x2014;and as the two stories gradually intersect, their juxtaposition explores the tangled roots of vulnerability and desire.</p><p>By the time the last polka has been danced and the bouquet tossed, <em>Midnight Champagne</em> has cast an extraordinary spell. From the novel's opening epigraph from Chekhov&#x2014;"If you fear loneliness, then marriage is not for you"&#x2014;to its final moments in the honeymoon suite, A. Manette Ansay weaves tenderness and fury, passion and wonder into a startling tapestry of love in all its paradox and power.</p></p><p>A. Manette Ansay's novel about a wedding day 30 miles north of the Illinois state line has some of the earthy authenticity and knowing emotional detail of Jane Smiley. Yet the comic, melancholic voice in <i>Midnight Champagne</i> is very much her own. The scene is Valentine's Day at the Great Lakes Chapel and Hideaway Lodge, amid Wisconsin winter fields "the featureless white of amnesia." The place used to be a raunchy roadhouse where "room 33" was (and perhaps still is!) the code word for an assignation. A less libidinous lady ghost is also said to wander the halls. But the real nightmares here are of the everyday variety. April, 22 years old, a rebel artist, is abruptly marrying her new boyfriend from Nashville. Her family can't see why she dropped her all-too-steady ex-beau Barney, who sold Scotchgard products at the local Magic Carpet. Brooding Barney, invited to the wedding by mistake, can't see why either--though flashbacks illuminate the reason. <p> As the nuptials hit various snags (like a storm that knocks out the lights), April's family and friends reflect on vanishing marital passion, the presence of an ex-husband's pregnant young wife, the emotional mosh pit of the bride's tossed bouquet, and the kids'-eye view of it all. One does yearn for a more take-charge omniscient narrator to fuse the many characters' insightful musings--the novel's got a scattery feel. But it's a privilege to meet these people, visit this real-seeming place, and savor such flavorful sentences. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><p>A.

At the same time, he shows that human sleep, as a restorative withdrawal that is intrinsically incompatible with 24/7 capitalism, points to other more formidable and collective refusals of world-destroying patterns of growth and accumulation.</p><p><b>Jonathan Crary</b> is Meyer Schapiro Professor of Modern Art and Theory at Columbia University.

Kristina lives in Stockholm.</p>The Chosen <br>Fear came with the darkness. He hated the nights. The distance between his own room and the safety of his parents&#x2019; bedroom seemed immense. Many times he had chosen to hide under the covers rather than venture out onto the dark landing outside his door.<br> <br>He could see that his mother was worried about his night terrors. He would scream out loud when he had bad dreams, and she always came running. Stroked his forehead and whispered that everything was all right. Switched on the bedside lamp and opened the blind.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing here, David. Nothing that could hurt you. Come and have a look and you&#x2019;ll see that there&#x2019;s nothing to worry about.&#x201d;<br> <br>Like all parents, she wanted him to look for himself, see that there were no dangers lurking outside.<br> <br>But David wasn&#x2019;t afraid of something you could see with the naked eye. He was afraid of something you weren&#x2019;t aware of until it was too late. Of dangers that moved with the darkness as their protector and silence as their companion. David was afraid of the danger against which there was no defense.<br> <br>It was Avital who had told him the story. Told him about the boy who hated children and who waited for them in the barren landscape around the village where they lived. The Paper Boy.<br> <br>&#x201c;He sleeps during the day and wakes up when the sun goes down,&#x201d; Avital said one day when they were hiding in his tree house so that David wouldn&#x2019;t have to go home. &#x201c;He picks out the child he wants, then he takes them.&#x201d;<br> <br>David felt his stomach turn over.<br> <br>&#x201c;How does he choose?&#x201d; he whispered.<br> <br>&#x201c;No one knows. The only thing we know is that no one is safe.&#x201d;<br> <br>David tried to swallow his fear.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re making it up.&#x201d;<br> <br>The floor of the tree house was hard, and the wind was so cold. He was wearing only shorts and a short-sleeved top, and he was starting to shiver.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am not!&#x201d;<br> <br>Avital had always been more daring. He was never scared, and he was always ready to fight for what he thought or what he wanted. But he was also a true friend. David&#x2019;s father had said more than once that Avital would be a good man and a good soldier when he grew up, the kind of man who always did the right thing, who stood up for his friends and his people. He never said what he thought about David, but David assumed he had a very different opinion of his own son.<br> <br>&#x201c;He comes at night, when we&#x2019;re asleep. He waits outside the window, and when we least expect it, he comes in and grabs us. So don&#x2019;t sleep with the window open,&#x201d; Avital said.<br> <br>Those words penetrated David&#x2019;s brain like nails and were impossible to remove. From then on his window had to remain closed.<br> <br>But when summer came and the dry heat rolled in across the country, his mother had had enough.<br> <br>&#x201c;Being too hot can make you ill, David. You have to let in the cool night air.&#x201d;<br> <br>He allowed her to open the window, then waited until she had gone to bed. When the house was silent, he tiptoed over and closed it. Only then could he get to sleep.<br> <br>Although you could never be completely sure.<br> <br>Avital explained this to him a little while later.<br> <br>&#x201c;When he gets angry, he becomes very strong, and then there are no doors, no walls, no windows that can keep him out. The only thing you can do is hope.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hope he chooses someone else.&#x201d;<br> <br>That did it. From then on, David&#x2019;s fear of sleeping alone was greater than his fear of making his way across the landing. Every night he crept into his parents&#x2019; room; they sent him away only if his little sister had gotten there first.<br> <br>&#x201c;In you come, sweetheart,&#x201d; his mother would whisper as he slipped under the covers.<br> <br>But he slept for no more than an hour or so as dawn was breaking, and that created more problems. He had just started school and was nodding off during lessons. The teachers were worried; they called his parents, who took him to the doctor.<br> <br>&#x201c;The boy is exhausted,&#x201d; the doctor said. &#x201c;A few days&#x2019; rest and he&#x2019;ll be as good as new.&#x201d;<br> <br>David was allowed to stay at home, and Avital came around after school with his books to tell him what they had been doing. David wished the teacher would send someone else. He had been trying to avoid Avital so that he wouldn&#x2019;t have to listen to any more of his terrifying stories, but it was as if he weren&#x2019;t meant to escape. As Avital zipped up his backpack and got ready to go home, he said:<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you seen him yet? At night?&#x201d;<br> <br>David shook his head.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think he&#x2019;ll come soon,&#x201d; Avital said.<br> <br>ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½<br> <br>It would be a while before his prophecy was fulfilled.<br> <br>Many years passed. David and Avital left the village where they had grown up and by chance ended up on the same kibbutz.<br> <br>And then he came. The Paper Boy. A child went missing from the kibbutz. For ten days and ten nights they searched for him&#x2014;adults, police officers, soldiers. Eventually they found his body, so badly mutilated that they didn&#x2019;t want to tell the other children what had happened to him.<br> <br>But they knew anyway.<br> <br>David and Avital, grown men by this time, looked at one another in silent understanding. They knew what had happened to the boy.<br> <br>The Paper Boy had taken him.<br> <br>And it was only a matter of time before he returned.</p><h2>The Toyota Landcruiser (On the Road)</h2><p>Describes the history, production, and different models of the Toyota Land Cruiser, a vehicle originally created to allow police and military to travel off paved roads</p><p>Michael Burgan has written more than 90 fiction and nonfiction books for children.

When Beret discovers the sordid truth of Lillie's death, she makes her way to Denver, determined to find her sister's murderer. Detective Mick McCauley may not want her involved in the case, but Beret is determined, and the investigation soon takes her from the dangerous, seedy underworld of Denver's tenderloin to the highest levels of Denver society.

She is a former Denver bureau chief for <i>Business Week </i>magazine and lives in Denver, Colorado.Chapter 1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>The woman stood in the doorway of the police department, looking over the room, her face tight. She was slender, tall, and might have been attractive if her hair under the drab hat had not been pulled back into a tight knot, making her forehead too high. She was dressed in a severe black suit, a traveling costume without a bustle or any of the absurd embellishments that women were affecting in 1885. At first glance, she might have looked a little like one of those dreadful mission solicitors, the sour women who held out their tambourines, demanding donations for the poor. But she was too poised, too neatly groomed, and she did not have the self-righteous look of a salvation peddler. <br>Most decent women who found themselves alone in the precinct with its tobacco-stained floors, its cigar-fouled air, amid Denver&#x2019;s snouts and boosters and other lowlife, were timid, uneasy. They stood nervously, red-faced, eyes downcast, sometimes shaking, until one of the detectives looked up and asked what they wanted. But Beret held herself erect, businesslike, as she scanned the room, daring anyone to question her presence. The truth was, she was a little unnerved at being in a place that was so distasteful to her, knowing as she did how squalid police stations were, how corrupt the inmates on both sides of the law might be. But it couldn&#x2019;t be helped, Beret told herself. <br>&#x201c;Help you, miss?&#x201d; A policeman spoke up at last. <br>Beret was startled by the question and almost blanched at the way the man looked her over, but she had had long experience in holding herself together and didn&#x2019;t flinch. &#x201c;I am looking for Detective Sergeant Michael McCauley.&#x201d; Her voice was low and rather pleasant and had not one hint of her unease. <br>A man at a desk glanced up as the policeman waved Beret in his direction. Ignoring the stares from the other lawmen in the room as well as the reprobates, Beret walked quickly to the desk and said, &#x201c;Detective Sergeant McCauley.&#x201d; It was a statement, not a question. She had learned that was the best way to approach a policeman&#x2014;or almost anybody, for that matter. <br>She did not appear to be a miscreant or the wife of some poor scapegrace come to beg for leniency for her husband. Perhaps that was why Mick stood up and nodded. &#x201c;I am. What can I do for you, miss?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve come about the death of Lillie Osmundsen.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re her mother?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Her sister.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, sorry, ma&#x2019;am. The light&#x2019;s poor in here.&#x201d; <br>Beret did not respond. Ten years older than her sister, Beret was used to being taken for Lillie&#x2019;s mother. <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t have guessed you were sisters,&#x201d; Mick said, after an awkward silence. <br>&#x201c;You mean I am not a beauty like my sister.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t say that at all.&#x201d; His reply was too hearty. <br>&#x201c;Then I hope you are more observant when it comes to searching for my sister&#x2019;s killer. It is obvious by far to anyone with a brain that she is beautiful, and I am unremarkable even on my best day.&#x201d; She should not have been so touchy. Then she added, &#x201c; <i>Was</i> beautiful.&#x201d; <br>Beret&#x2019;s voice was strident, and Mick frowned. &#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am. I&#x2019;m real sorry she passed over.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes. Thank you. I believe the term is &#x2018;murder.&#x2019;&#x201d; Beret had repeated the word over and over in her mind, but she found it difficult to say it out loud, and she bit her lip to keep it from quivering. What an awful thing to have to say about one&#x2019;s sister. <br>&#x201c;Murder,&#x201d; Mick repeated. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what it is, all right.&#x201d; <br>Beret felt her knees grow weak and asked, &#x201c;May I sit down?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; Mick pulled a chair from a nearby desk and placed it beside his own. Both seated themselves. <br>They stared at each other until Mick broke the silence. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve come for your sister&#x2019;s effects, the judge has them. There wasn&#x2019;t much, a few trinkets. We had to break into her trunk because we couldn&#x2019;t find a key. That&#x2019;s when we learned her identity. I hoped there might be something there that&nbsp;&#x2026; well&nbsp;&#x2026; would have helped us, but there wasn&#x2019;t. Hettie Hamilton, she&#x2019;s the, uh, the&nbsp;&#x2026; owner&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The madam, you mean.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah, sure, that&#x2019;s right, the madam. She said your sister had some diamond earrings that were missing. I guess you&#x2019;d like to have them if we find them.&#x201d; <br>Beret did not want the detective sergeant to think she was mercenary. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve not come here for diamond earrings.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Mick waited her out. <br>&#x201c;I came to ask what success you have had in finding the man who killed my&nbsp;&#x2026; my unfortunate sister.&#x201d; Beret took a deep breath and held it. <br>Mick nodded. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve sure been working on it. We&#x2019;re doing our best.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Does that mean there&#x2019;s been no progress?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You can rest easy that we&#x2019;ll leave no stone unturned&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>Beret interrupted. &#x201c;My sister is dead, my only sister. I did not come here for platitudes. Nor do I wish to be coddled. I want to know if you are close to finding Lillie&#x2019;s killer. And if you are not, why not. You may speak plainly.&#x201d; She detested men who treated her like an imbecile. Such straightforwardness in a woman was not a redeeming quality in most men&#x2019;s eyes, but Beret did not care. Lillie had been the carefree one, the flirt, the one who drew men like cats to cream, just as Beret had always been drawn to her. <br>She wondered if the detective was competent or if he was simply some political appointee. He was nice looking, tall, with reddish-blond hair, not gone to fat from too much free food and drink like so many officers she had encountered. Most detectives were untrained, she knew, and their appointment was political. It was unlikely this man knew much about investigating serious crime. She stared at Mick until he looked away. <br>&#x201c;We have some ideas, men she might have known,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;And they are?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t say just now.&#x201d; Mick looked at two men sitting nearby who were listening in on the conversation. He smirked and pointed with his chin at one of them. &#x201c;That pickpocket with the copper tried to lift the wallet of the Reverend Tom Uzzell, no less. He must be new in town or else he&#x2019;d have known that the Reverend Uzzell would have given him the money if he&#x2019;d asked but would come down hard on any poor thug who tried to steal it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I am not here to discuss pickpockets,&#x201d; Beret said, glancing around the room and taking in the stares, the silence as the policemen as well as the malefactors tried to determine her business in the station. &#x201c;I see that this is not a place conducive to conversation. Well, Detective, I have not had luncheon. Is there somewhere I can get a cup of coffee and a bowl of soup, a place where we can have a private conversation?&#x201d; <br>Mick pulled out his pocket watch as if to show he was pressed for time, but he nodded. He stood, and Beret let him take her elbow and propel her back through the room to the door. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a restaurant down the street, if you&#x2019;re not too choosy. The food isn&#x2019;t the best, but it&#x2019;s cheap.&#x201d; The two went up the stairs from the basement of City Hall, where the station was located, Beret raising her skirt to keep it away from the vermin and the wads of chewing tobacco that repelled even the rats. Out on the street, Mick pointed to a little cafï¿½ a few doors away. <br>&#x201c;I imagine you would rather have a drink, but I am not fond of coffee in saloons,&#x201d; Beret said, and Mick&#x2019;s mouth dropped in surprise. Beret saw that and smiled to herself. She did like shocking people&#x2014;sometimes, at any rate. She and Lillie had had that in common. She felt a stab of pain at the thought of her sister. <br>The two walked down Larimer Street, Denver&#x2019;s major thoroughfare, past an undertaker&#x2019;s parlor, a clothing store, a drugstore, without talking, until they reached the Parr Cafï¿½. Mick opened the door, and Beret preceded him into the restaurant, glancing around the room at the wooden tables bare of any cloths, the mismatched chairs, at the black-and-white marble floor that was chipped and stained. She headed for a table in the back. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not much,&#x201d; apologized Mick. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve dined in far worse. Do you eat here often?&#x201d; she asked. <br>&#x201c;I prefer the saloon lunches.&#x201d; <br>He&#x2019;d paid her back for her jibe, but Beret liked that. She wouldn&#x2019;t want to work with a policeman who felt he had to sugarcoat everything he said because she was a lady. She hoped they would get along. &#x201c;Well, have you eaten here often enough to recommend something?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Chili. But it will burn your tongue.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Chili, then,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And coffee. Will you join me, Detective? I am paying, of course.&#x201d; Beret was well aware that the policeman made eighty-five dollars a month, a hundred if he was lucky&#x2014;plus whatever he got on the take. <br>&#x201c;Chili gives me the heartburn.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What a pity. I&#x2019;m rather fond of it myself, the hotter the better. Perhaps there is something else you would like.&#x201d; <br>After Mick ordered for Beret, asking for coffee and a piece of apple pie with a slice of cheese for himself, Beret put her hands on the table and looked directly at the detective. &#x201c;Now, perhaps you will tell me the circumstances of my sister&#x2019;s murder.&#x201d; Her voice was calm, but inside, her heart was churning. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a pretty picture.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t imagine murder ever is.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m talking about your sister&#x2019;s life. Do you know about it, miss?&#x201d; <br>At that, Beret almost lost her composure. Tears came to her eyes, and she turned aside. Mick apparently had no handkerchief to offer, so he patted her hand, but she did not want his patronizing and snatched her hand away. &#x201c;You must forgive me. I&#x2019;ve no experience in this.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I should hope not.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I mean in the murder of my sister. I am all too familiar with death itself.&#x201d; <br>Mick waited for her to explain, but she didn&#x2019;t. She sat, self-absorbed, thinking it was a good thing she knew about the sordid life of the underworld. It would make dealing with Lillie&#x2019;s murder easier. But maybe not. Nothing could ease the tearing of her soul that her sister&#x2019;s death had brought. <br>The chili came, and she ate it as easily as if it were pudding. &#x201c;I know, Officer, that Lillie worked in a brothel,&#x201d; she said as she finished the chili and put down her spoon. <br>&#x201c;Not for very long, it seems, no more than three months.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Does it matter how long? She was a prostitute.&#x201d; Beret blanched as she said the words out loud for the first time. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not easy for you&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Of course it&#x2019;s not easy for me,&#x201d; she snapped. &#x201c;How would you like to discover your own sister was a woman of the streets?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I only meant&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>Beret dismissed him with a wave of her hand. &#x201c;I apologize, Officer. My sister&#x2019;s choice of profession is not your fault.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, but it was someone&#x2019;s fault, and I&#x2019;d like to find out who was responsible. In my position, you get used to death, but there was something about Lillie&nbsp;&#x2026; that is, Miss Osmundsen&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, she had that effect on men, even in death, it seems.&#x201d; Oh yes, Beret thought. She did. <br>The sergeant ignored the implication and continued, &#x201c;Something about her makes me want to find her killer. She was so young.&#x201d; He cleared his throat. &#x201c;Do you know anything about your sister&#x2019;s murder?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know very little. In fact, my aunt and uncle hoped to keep the circumstances of Lillie&#x2019;s death from me. At first, they told me only that she had died. They didn&#x2019;t want me to come to Denver. They said everything had been taken care of, that I should grieve at home in New York.&#x201d; As she remembered the telegram, Beret sipped from her cup, ignoring the fact the coffee was stale and burned and not very warm. &#x201c;They were looking out for me, of course.&#x201d; She added to herself, As I did not look out for Lillie. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>She had found the telegram mixed in with the mail on the parlor table, had overlooked it until Maggie, the housekeeper, pointed it out, because Beret rarely received telegrams. Then she&#x2019;d snatched it up with a premonition that it held bad news. But then, telegrams always seemed to bring bad news. The message was brief, cryptic, and told her in as few words as possible that her sister, Lillie, had died suddenly. Her funeral was being held that very day. She would be buried in Riverside Cemetery, in a plot set aside for her aunt and uncle. Everything had been neatly handled, so there was no need for Beret to make the long train trip from New York to Denver. The aunt and uncle sent their condolences. The telegram was signed Judge and Mrs. John Stanton. <br>Beret&#x2019;s hands shook, and her eyes clouded as she walked to the telegraph office to wire back her response, her condolences, for after all, the Stantons had taken Lillie under their wing when Beret would have nothing to do with her. Lillie had fled to Denver after the sisters had had their falling-out. <br>As an afterthought, Beret asked the cause of death. Lillie had always been healthy, and Beret wondered if her sister had died in an accident. Her aunt and uncle were right that there was no reason for her to make the trip. The funeral was done with, and Lillie might as well sleep for eternity in the Stanton plot. Beret&#x2019;s traveling to Denver to grieve for her sister would be hypocritical. At least, that was what she told herself. The real reason she hadn&#x2019;t wanted to go was she did not know how to act in front of her aunt and uncle. Did they know about the rift between the sisters? Surely they did. Would they blame Beret? Would she have to reveal the details, to relive that awful time? After she thought it over, Beret realized her reaction was more about herself than about her sister. Lillie was dead, and that changed everything. <br>The news brought a wave of emotion to the young woman, conflicting emotions that she knew she would have to sort through in the following days in her methodical way. At first, she was overwhelmed by grief. She remembered Lillie as the angel-child she had been as a little girl, her golden curls and curious blue eyes, her sunny temperament, the child&#x2019;s grief when first their mother, Marta, and then their father, Henry, had died, and Beret, young as she was, had taken the responsibility of raising her. <br>And then Beret was angry, as she remembered Lillie in the last year, her sister&#x2019;s devilish betrayal, the hate that developed between them. Something about the telegram didn&#x2019;t sit right with Beret. It was wrong that Lillie was dead. The thing between them had not been settled. Beret had expected Lillie to repent, to beg forgiveness, and when she did, Beret would hold out her arms, because after all, wasn&#x2019;t the bond between sisters stronger than any other? But Lillie had died, leaving Beret&#x2019;s arms empty, the business between them unfinished. <br>Beret returned from the telegraph office but could not eat supper and had gone to bed, and to her surprise, she had put her face into her pillow and cried, cried first from loss and then from rage as she realized she would never be able to extract the remorse from Lillie that was due. <br>She slept poorly, going out at dawn and walking far downtown, along streets enveloped in a gray mist and smelling of animal droppings and cheap kerosene, walking carefully past the human refuse that was huddled against the buildings, ignoring the stench from the bodies and the ragged clothing. She watched a fetid pile of rags move. A woman slowly rose to her feet and took a step or two, then fell to the ground and curled back into a ball. A man in a soiled apron stood in the window of a restaurant, shucking oysters, for at that early hour, men were coming off work for their supper of beer and mollusks. Two newsboys fought over a street corner, the larger boy pushing the smaller one into the thoroughfare and stamping on his hat. She&#x2019;d gone to the boy who was sitting in the gutter crying out filthy words, and bought a penny paper from him, giving him a dime for it. The lad started to give her change, but Ber...</p><h2>Porgy</h2><p><p>The fictional characters of Porgy, Bess, Black Maria, Sportin' Life, and the other Gullah denizens of Catfish Row have attained a mythic status and have become inextricably identified with Charleston. This novel is the story of Porgy, a crippled street-beggar in the black tenement. Unwashed and un-wanted, he lives just on the edge of subsistence and trusts his fate to the gods and chance. His one shining moment is his pursuit of Bess, whom he wins and then loses during one summer of passion and violence. </p><p>This story by DuBose Heyward is, of course, the origin of George Gershwin's acclaimed folk opera <i>Porgy and Bess</i>. Heyward created Porgy with such sympathy, honesty, and insight that Porgy has ascended into the pantheon of the universal. </p><p>This Banner Books edition includes an afterword by James M. Hutchisson, Heyward's biographer, who places <i>Porgy</i> in its social and historical context and shows how the novel revolutionized American literature. Heyward had no literary training, and he wrote <i>Porgy</i> while working as an insurance agent. It is ironic that this deeply feeling author was a member of the Charleston aristocracy which regarded African Americans as little more than servants. Indeed, the tightly knit black community is celebrated in the novel and is contrasted with Charleston's white culture, which in Heyward's view lacked the vitality and rich social ethos of the Gullahs. </p><p>In 1927, even before Gershwin transformed the novel with a musical score, the book was successfully dramatized for the New York stage. The production revolutionized the black theater movement with its casting of black actors. </p><p><i>Porgy</i>, published in 1925, proved to be on the leading edge of the great southern renaissance, in which works by William Faulkner, Eudora Welty, and others would depict black characters of increasing emotional and psychological complexity. The novel has gone through seven editions and has been translated into French, Gullah, and German, among other languages and dialects. </p><p>DuBose Heyward (1885-1940) published <i>Porgy</i> to tremendous critical acclaim and financial success. He wrote poetry, short fiction, plays, and screenplays. James M.

To save someone else&#39;s life.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, July 2012:</strong> Harold Fry--retired sales rep, beleaguered husband, passive observer of his own life--decides one morning to walk 600 miles across England to save an old friend. It might not work, mind you, but that's hardly the point. In playwright Rachel Joyce's pitch-perfect first novel, Harold wins us over with his classic antiheroism. Setting off on the long journey, he wears the wrong jacket, doesn't have a toothbrush, and leaves his phone at home--in short, he is wholly, endearingly unprepared. But as he travels, Harold finally has time to reflect on his failings as a husband, father, and friend, and this helps him become someone we (and, more important, his wife Maureen) can respect. After walking for a while in Harold Fry's very human shoes, you might find that your own fit a bit better. --<i>Mia Lipman</i>Rachel Joyce lives in Gloucestershire with her husband and four children.

With his novel aesthetic inspired by Art Brut (a term he coined), Dubuffet succeeded in breaking away from modernist conventions and redefining the concept of art, and in doing so leaving his mark on the second half of the 20th century and exercising a considerable influence on numerous young artists. <i>Jean Dubuffet: Metamorphoses of Landscape</i>&#x2015;the first substantial English-language Dubuffet monograph in decades&#x2015;is published for a large-scale retrospective at the Fondation Beyeler, with around 100 major works from all of the artist&#x2019;s important creative phases. It opens with an exploration of Dubuffet&#x2019;s multilayered notion of landscape, which the artist transforms into bodies, faces or objects. Dubuffet experimented with new techniques and materials, and in the process created a completely independent, fascinating pictorial cosmos. Besides important paintings and sculptures from international museums and private collections, the book also presents the ensemble of figures from Dubuffet&#x2019;s stage play <i>Coucou Bazar</i>, his unparalleled Gesamtkunstwerk synthesis of the arts. <br>The French painter, sculptor and writer <b>Jean Dubuffet</b> (1901&#x2013;85) evolved his style of art from pictures created spontaneously by children, self-taught artists and the mentally ill. In 1948 he founded the Compagnie de l&#x2019;Art Brut which advocated working artistically outside the bounds of art-canon norms and academic training. During this decade he developed a powerful reputation in the US, where his work was championed by Clement Greenberg and the Abstract Expressionists; he also forged close relationships with writers and artists such as Henri Michaux, Francis Ponge and Antonin Artaud. In 1962 he developed a semi-figurative, semi-abstract artistic idiom in a large series of works he called <i>Hourloupe</i>. In his later work Dubuffet returned to the gestural techniques of Art Informel.</p><p></p><h2>Blood Covenant</h2><p>Paperback Blood Covenant By Theo Wolmarans This is the most powerful and important subject in the Bible... the foundation of the Christian life.</p><p></p><h2>From New York to Corrymore: Robert Henri and Ireland</h2><p>From the time of his first trip to Ireland in 1913 and his last trip in 1928, American artist Robert Henri created masterful paintings of the Irish landscape and people, particularly children.

Against a tableau of famous historical figures-among them G.H. Hardy, the self-taught Indian genius Srinivasa Ramanujan, and a young Kurt Godel-Petros works furiously to prove the notoriously difficult conjecture. Decades later, his ambitious young nephew drives the defeated mathematician back into the hunt to prove Goldbach's Conjecture. . . but at the cost of the old man's sanity, and perhaps even his life.</p></p><p>"Every family has its black sheep--in ours it was Uncle Petros." The narrator of Apostolos Doxiadis's first novel, <i>Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture</i>, is unable to understand the reasons for his uncle's fall from grace. A kindly, gentle recluse devoted only to gardening and chess, Petros Papachristos exhibits no sign of dissolution or indolence: so why is he held in such low esteem? One day, his brother reveals all: <blockquote> 'Your Uncle Petros cast pearls before swine; he took something holy and sacred and great, and shamelessly defiled it!' ... 'His <i>gift</i>, of course!' ... 'The great, unique gift that God had blessed him with, his phenomenal, unprecedented, mathematical talent! The miserable fool wasted it; he squandered it and threw it out with the garbage. Can you imagine it? The ungrateful bastard never did one day's useful work in mathematics. Never! Nothing! Zero!' </blockquote> Needless to say, such apoplexy only provokes the boy's curiosity, and what he eventually discovers is a story of obsession and frustration, of Uncle Petros's attempts at finding a proof for one of mathematics' great enigmas--Goldbach's Conjecture. <p> The innumerate may initially find this undramatic material for a novel. Yet Doxiadis offers up a beautifully imagined narrative, which reveals a rarefied world of the intellect that few people will ever enter, in which numbers are entirely animate entities, each possessed of "a distinct personality." Without ever alienating the reader, he demonstrates the enchantments of this art as well as the ambition, envy, and search for glory that permeate its apostles. Balancing the narrator's own awkward move into adulthood with the painful memories of his brilliant relative, Doxiadis shows how seductive the world of numbers can be, and how cruel a mistress. "A mathematician is born, not made," Petros declares--an inheritance that proves both a curse and a gift. <i>--Burhan Tufail</i></p>"A mathematical conjecture unsolved for two centuries; a mathematical genius uncle driven mad trying to solve it; an ambiguous relation with a mathematically-minded nephew; and acute human observation all come together in Uncle Petros to make a very funny, tender, charming and, to my mind, irresistible novel."--Oliver Sacks, M.D. <p>"Paints a fascinating picture of how a mathematician could fall into a mental trap by devoting his efforts to a too difficult problem."--John Nash, Nobel Laureate, 1994, subject of A Beautiful Mind </p><p>"It is brilliantly written-a mathematical detective story of great charm-and it certainly succeeds in capturing much of the spirit of mathematical research."--Sir Michael Atiyah, winner of the Fields Medal and world-renowned mathematician</p></p><h2>The Royal School of Needlework Embroidery Techniques</h2><p>An introduction to the most popular hand embroidery techniques.

By then the burglar who broke into Cass Ridley's apartment and stole the "tip" she got for her last run has already tried to spend one of the $100 bills from her stash, attracting the attention of the Secret Service. The "superbill" is phony, and by the time Carella and his crew uncover the international counterfeit ring behind it, McBain has notched up the action with a terrorist plot to bomb Clarendon (read Carnegie) Hall, where an eminent Israeli violinist is performing. There's also a conspiracy involving a publishing company whose sales reps are so venal and violent you might think they were the creation of a writer who blamed them when his last book failed to sell. Not so McBain, who can't have too many complaints in that department. His publisher's reps have been living well for decades on the commissions earned on McBain's books (including those of Evan Hunter, his alter ego).</p><p> That he has kept this series going for so long without tricking up the plots, turning his characters into stereotypes, or sacrificing their humanity is a tribute to his authorial gifts: expert pacing, sharp-edged dialogue, authenticity, wit, and confidence. There's only thing getting old in this, his 51st book in an evergreen series: the fictional convention that locates the 87th in a place called Isola instead of midtown Manhattan, where it so clearly is set. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><b>Ed McBain</b> returns to his legendary 87th Precinct with a suspenseful story of greed, conflict, and the eternal search for money, money, money. is the only American ever to receive the Diamond Dagger, the British Crime Writers Association's highest award.

This follow-up button-pusher would pair perfectly with Alissa Nutting&#x2019;s controversial TAMPA (2013), if not for the opening scene: a terrified 11-year-old boy gagged and handcuffed to a bed while our narrator, sixth-grade English teacher Mona Straw, licks the dirt from his feet. From there, we backtrack to learn of Mona&#x2019;s evolving infatuation with student Connor Blue, a kid as average and unremarkable as his teacher. Connor soon graduates from extra study lessons to yard work to an overwhelming sexual relationship, with every step utterly believable as Mona cycles through giddy elation, mordant depression, and, most of all, tortured self-justifications of her actions: &#x2018;The top buttons are undone on the blouse but that&#x2019;s because I&#x2019;m just casually hanging around the house, no other reason.&#x2019; Conlon&#x2019;s prose is so sturdy that Mona&#x2019;s impaired viewpoint (for example, her concern that the power of their relationship is shifting to Connor) almost makes sense before it plunges them both into unavoidable disaster.

These royal robes, which weigh fifty pounds and more and cost an average of $18,000, are highly embellished with rhinestones and beads. The Coronation is part of the ten-day, century-old festival celebrating the final battle of the 1836 Texas revolt against Mexico.This book provides a significant contribution to the study of social elites in Western society through a material culture analysis of the Coronation costumes worn by the Euro-American debutantes. Set against the backdrop of a city undergoing many demographic, socioeconomic, and political changes, the themes of Coronation pageants represent the mythologized ethnic and class history which reinforces the hierarchical positioning of its participants. The royal robes serve as the canvas upon which this theme is carried out. The Coronation, held in a city with a Hispanic majority, has come under attack for its elitism, but participation in it is still important for the old Euro-American aristocracy and for a very few extremely wealthy Hispanic families. Integral to the continuation of this increasingly contested tradition is the emotional appeal that wearing these intricately decorated gowns holds for participants.</p><p>Michaele Thurgood Haynes The Witte Museum,San Antonio, Texas<p>&#x201c;'Haynes' histories of San Antonio, the relationship between Anglos and the predominant Mexican population, and the growth of Fiesta into a ten-day-long celebration with over 150 events are informative as well as entertaining.

(History of Everyday Things Series). CIP. Bedrick, dist. by Harper. July 1985. PSm $12.95. Grade 6-8 Densely illustrated, tersely written, these two volumes are fascinating. The first book covers the period of 4,000,000 b.c. to 300 b.c. and includes chapters on Ice Age hunters, Minoan Crete, China, the Etruscans and the Greeks. The second covers the years 50 b.c. to 1300 a.d. and includes the Celts, Anglo-Saxons, Byzantium, Arabs in Europe, the Vikings, Monastic living and a Medieval town. Hundreds of color drawings depict tools, artifacts, dress, weapons and lodging, recreating the domestic side of these civilizations. Illustrations and diagrams are accompanied by detailed legends; paragraphs of text basically set the historical framework, explaining major points in each civilization. A chronology with page numbers appearing at the back of each book clarifies the sense of time covered and acts as a sort of index. The books' British origin is most evident in the metric measurements and the bibliography. Students will find much, however, to flesh out reports or add a sense of realism to more standard historical works. These are excellent additions to R. J. Unstead's See Inside a Roman Town (1978) and See Inside a Castle (1979, both Warwick; o.p.), which are aimed at a younger audience and C. H. Quennell's Everyday Life in Roman and Anglo-Saxon Times (Batsford, 1969) and Fiona MacDonald's Everyday Life in the Middle Ages (Silver, 1984), which are not as heavily illustrated.

Around the walls of the grim frontier town of Florentia, the exhausted remnants of Rhadagastus&#x2019;s barbarian army were awakening, to find themselves no longer surrounded by the implacable legionaries of Rome. Slowly, uncertainly, and with a defeated air, they began to break camp and make for the hills to the north.</p><p>On another hill to the south, commanding a fine view of the retreat, and surveying the scene with some satisfaction, sat two Roman officers on horse back, resplendent in breastplates of bronze and plumes of scarlet.</p><p>"Shall I give the order, sir?" said the younger of the two.</p><p>General Stilicho kept his gaze on the unfolding scene below. "Thank you, Tribune, but I shall do it myself when good and ready." Impertinent puppy, he thought, with your bought commission and your unscarred limbs.</p><p>From far below arose clouds of dust, partially obscuring the sight of the barbarians&#x2019; great wooden wagons as they creaked and rolled out of the camp and made their way northward. The two Roman officers on the hill could hear the crack of bullwhips and the cries of men as this motley and vagabond army of Vandals and Sueves, renegade Goths, Lombards, and Franks, began its long retreat back beyond the Alpine passes to their tribal homelands.</p><p>Rome would survive their attentions a little longer yet.</p><p>Rhadagastus&#x2019;s ferocious horde of Germanic warriors had been united only in their lust for gold, and their fierce delight in destruction. They had cut a crimson swathe across half of Europe, from their homelands on the cold Baltic shores, or out on the vast Scythian steppes, to the vineyards of Provence and the golden hills of Tuscany, until they eventually came to a halt at the city of Florentia. Once there, they besieged that sternly fortified colony of Rome on the banks of the Arno. But the great General Stilicho, as imperturbable as ever, rode north from Rome to meet them, with an army perhaps only a fifth the size of Rhadagastus&#x2019;s&#x2014;but an army trained in the arts of siege craft as well as war.</p><p>As is so often said, for every day that a Roman soldier wields a sword, he spends a hundred days wielding a shovel. No one digs a trench like a Roman soldier. And soon the besiegers of the city found themselves in turn besieged. The surrounding army, though fewer in number, had access to vital supplies from the nearby country, to food and water, fresh horses, and even new weaponry. The surrounded army, however, forcibly enclosed in its camp under the heat of the Tuscan August sun, was in no better circumstances than Florentia itself. The trapped barbarians had no resources they could draw on, and slowly began to expire.</p><p>In desperation, the frustrated and stricken Germans threw themselves against the barriers that surrounded them, but to no avail. Their horses shied and whinnied, hooves cruelly pierced by the iron caltrops the Romans had scattered across the hard-baked ground, throwing their furious riders beneath the unyielding entrenchments and ramparts, where they were soon despatched by archers up on the embankment. Those who tried to attack their besiegers on foot found themselves having to descend into a ditch six feet in depth, and then struggle out the far side, an equal climb, and up against three lines of wicked sharpened staves. Behind them were lined the Roman spearmen with their long, thrusting javelins. It was an impossible barrier. Those barbarians not slain on the barricades returned to their tents and lay down in exhaustion and despair.</p><p>When Stilicho reckoned Rhadagastus had lost as much as a third of his forces, he gave the order for the Romans to break camp in the night and withdraw into the surrounding hills. And so now, as dawn broke, the baffled and exhausted northern tribes found themselves free to move off as well&#x2014;homeward.</p><p>Nevertheless, once they were rolling and in thorough disorder, it would be good to send in the new auxiliaries and see what they could do. Stilicho took no fine pleasure in seeing men cut down on a battlefield&#x2014;unlike some generals he could mention. But the vast and undisciplined rabble below, which that troublesome warlord Rhadagastus had pulled together for the summer campaigning season, remained a threat to Rome&#x2019;s northern borders, even in defeat. A final harrying attack from these new mounted troops, however lightweight, would certainly do no harm.</p><p>At last, with the barbarian army chaotically strung out across the plain, and its vanguard nudging into the foothills to the north, General Stilicho gave the nod.</p><p>"Send them in," he said.</p><p>His tribune relayed the signal down the line, and only moments later Stilicho saw with some surprise that the auxiliaries had already started their gallop.</p><p>Not that he expected much from them. They were small men, these new warriors from the east, and lightly armed. They favored their neat bows and arrows over all other weapons, and even rode into battle with lassos&#x2014;as if about to ride down a bunch of sleepy-eyed heifers! Who ever won a battle with mere rope? And Rhadagastus&#x2019;s warriors, even in defeat, were no sleepy-eyed heifers.</p><p>As well as being small and lightly armed, these horse men fought without armor, naked to the waist, with only a fine coating of dust over their coppery, leathery skins for protection. They would do little damage to the retreating army, it was clear, but it would be interesting to see them in action, all the same. No Roman had yet seen them fight, although many had heard vainglorious and unlikely reports of their prowess at arms. They were said to move fast on their shaggy little steppe ponies, so perhaps some use could be found for them in future in the imperial courier ser vice . . . With luck, they might even manage to ride down Rhadagastus himself, and bring him in as a captive. It was a long bow shot, but worth a try.</p><p>Well, reports of their impressive turn of speed, at any rate, had not been exaggerated.</p><p>The horsemen came thundering out from a shallow valley to the east, and made straight for the stricken column of retreating barbarians. Good enough tactics: the sun behind them, and straight in their enemies&#x2019; eyes. Stilicho was too far away to see the expressions on the faces of Rhadagastus&#x2019;s men, of course, but the way the column slowed, and jostled, and the air filled with panicked cries, and then the heavy wagons lurched desperately forward again, trying to make for the safety of the rough ground and the hills before the furious charge of the eastern horse men could hit them&#x2014;such things told him Rhadagastus&#x2019;s warriors weren&#x2019;t smiling.</p><p>The horsemen&#x2019;s thunderous charge drummed up a fine dust from the sun-baked late-summer plains, and Stilicho and his tribune strained to see. Then something darkened the air between them. At first they could barely comprehend.</p><p>"Is that . . . Is that what I think it is, sir?"</p><p>Stilicho was dumbfounded. It was indeed what it seemed. The very air was dark with them. An unimaginable storm of arrows.</p><p>He had heard that these people were good on horseback; and he had heard good things of their unprepossessing little bows. But nothing had prepared him for this.</p><p>The arrows fell in an endless rain, like murderous stinging insects, upon Rhadagastus&#x2019;s outflanked column, and the stricken Germans began to grind to a halt, their path blocked by the piled-up corpses of their own men. Then the horsemen, the fury of their charge undiminished even after covering a mile or more of hard, sunbaked ground&#x2014;long after a troop of Roman cavalry would have begun to slacken and tire&#x2014;scythed into the aghast and petrified column.</p><p>Both Stilicho and his tribune had their fists bunched up on the pommels of their saddles, pushing themselves up and straining to see.</p><p>"In the Name of Light," murmured the general.</p><p>"Have you ever seen anything like it, sir?" said the tribune.</p><p>The horsemen cut through the column in seconds, then, with unbelievable dexterity, wheeled round and cut in again from the other side. Rhadagastus&#x2019;s warriors, even after their weeks of starvation and sickness under the walls of Florentia, were now trying to establish some kind of formation and repel the attack. These tall, blond spearmen, these fierce and skilful swordsmen, fought back with the ferocity of the doomed. But the ferocity of their attackers was greater. Nearer to where they sat their horses, the two Roman officers could see breakaway groups of mounted auxiliaries wheeling and turning about as if with pure delight, effortlessly slaughtering the helpless, milling Germans. And they also saw the deadly effect of the easterners&#x2019; lassos. Any barbarian who tried to mount up and ride was instantly brought down again by the whistle and lash of the cruel noose, cast with terrible, casual accuracy. The victim fell in a tangle of reins and limbs, and was quickly despatched where he lay.</p><p>Stilicho watched with amazement as the horsemen, even up close, long after Roman cavalry would have drawn their longswords, continued to use their short bows and arrows. He could now see, as the fighting spread out in disorder below them, why their fighting skill was so renowned. He watched a single horseman notch an arrow to his bow, fire it into the back of a fleeing German, and snatch another arrow from his quiver as he swung round on his horse&#x2019;s bare back. He notched it, leaned down at an incredible angle to take cover alongside the body of his mount, holding on with his thigh muscles alone, then sprang back up and loosed another arrow almost into the face of a German running at him with ax swinging. The arrow punched straight through and came out of the back of the axman&#x2019;s head in a spew of blood and brain. The horse man had notched another arrow to his bow and galloped on before the warrior hit the ground.</p><p>Galloped!

Until now.<br><br>Acclaimed journalist and author Jimmy McDonough expertly tackles this most elusive of subjects and aims to present readers with the definitive portrait of a man everyone knows but few understand. McDonough manages to break through Green's joyous veneer to reveal the contrary, tortured, and solitary individual beneath, a man who spent decades dancing an uneasy tightrope between the sacred and the profane. From his childhood in the backwaters of Arkansas to commanding the stage in front of throngs of lusting fans to addressing a very different audience from the pulpit of his own church, readers will bear witness to the creation of some of the most electrifying soul music ever recorded; learn the hitherto untold real story behind Green's colorful down-home Memphis label, Hi Records; and--by way of countless in-depth interviews with major players in the story, some speaking for the very first time--unravel one of the last great mysteries in popular music: Al Green.<br></p><p><b>Jimmy McDonough</b> is a journalist and biographer best known for his biographies of Tammy Wynette, Neil Young, Russ Meyer, and Andy Milligan. McDonough lives in the Pacific Northwest."Making the complexities of past subjects like Neil Young seem quaint by comparison, Jimmy McDonough has taken on the challenge of a lifetime: explaining the enduring mystery of Al Green. A compulsively readable and often disquieting tale, <i>Soul Survivor</i> helps us understand the mass of contradictions that comprise the Reverend's life story, as well as the warring factions that continue to battle within his heart and mind. A truly remarkable look at Al Green's soul--the music and the man."--<b>Bob Mehr</b>, author of <i>Trouble Boys: The True Story of the Replacements</i><br>"Deacon McDonough scrutinizes the inscrutable and finds many Al Greens.

In beautiful prose, Sapphistries tells their stories, capturing the multitude of ways that diverse societies have shaped female same-sex sexuality across time and place.<br>Leila J. Rupp reveals how, from the time of the very earliest societies, the possibility of love between women has been known, even when it is feared, ignored, or denied. We hear women in the sex-segregated spaces of convents and harems whispering words of love. We see women beginning to find each other on the streets of London and Amsterdam, in the aristocratic circles of Paris, in the factories of Shanghai. We find women&#x2019;s desire and love for women meeting the light of day as Japanese schoolgirls fall in love, and lesbian bars and clubs spread from 1920s Berlin to 1950s Buffalo. And we encounter a world of difference in the twenty-first century, as transnational concepts and lesbian identities meet local understandings of how two women might love each other.<br>Giving voice to words from the mouths and pens of women, and from men&#x2019;s prohibitions, reports, literature, art, imaginings, pornography, and court cases, Rupp also creatively employs fiction to imagine possibilities when there is no historical evidence. Sapphistries combines lyrical narrative with meticulous historical research, providing an eminently readable and uniquely sweeping story of desire, love, and sex between women around the globe from the beginning of time to the present.</p></p><p><b>Leila J. Rupp</b> is Professor of Feminist Studies and Associate Dean of the Division of Social Sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara. She is author of many books, including A Desired Past: A Short History of Same-Sex Sexuality in America."Sapphistries is amazing.." (John D'Emilio,author of Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America)<br><br>"Judicious, copious, scholarly and heartfelt, it will appeal equally to general readers and serious historians for its carefully chosen content and its novel methodology... As to methodology, Rupp is an old school historian who scrupulously recognizes the limitations of her craft, but who doesnt let those limitations keep her from rich imaginings and a refreshingly humane interest in the historical record... Sixty six pages of endnotes attest to the seriousness of the work; over two hundred pages of lucid and accessible prose make history fun again." (<i>Salem Press, Magill Book Reviews</i>)<br><br>"A fascinating book about the history of same-sex female attraction. . .reminds the reader all too poignantly never to take hard-won sexual freedoms for granted." (<i>Bust Magazine</i>)<br><br>"The narrative shines when Rupp describes love between women in its many forms, whether innocent (the schoolgirl &amp; raves of early twentieth-century England) or romantic (intense &amp; romantic friendships throughout the Western world) or outright erotic. With acute cultural sensitivity and a panoramic scope stretching from early Native American societies to contemporary India, Rupp delivers an academically rigorous and brilliantly told history." (<i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i>)<br><br>"Rupps intellectually ambitious monograph attempts to present and trace the diverse threads of lesbian history in a worldwide and comparative framework... The resulting text is thought-provoking, readable, and challenging and belongs in every college and university library." (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>"Sapphistries: A Global History of Love Between Women achieves what it set out to do by providing an overview of lesbian love from a historical and cultural perspective." (<i>Popmatters.com</i>)<br><br>"Rupps sweeping and highly readable synthesis of womens same-sex love and sexuality is also a finely crafted work of historical analysis. Her deep knowledge of the sources, from ancient to modern times, is truly impressive, while her use of literary imaginings make this a unique contribution to sexuality studies." (Estelle Freedman,author of No Turning Back)<br><br>"This is a useful source text that expands, rather than contracts, the interpretations of erotic subjectivities among women who desire women." (<i>Historian</i>)<br><br>"Rupp has given us an invaluable history that promises to inform and inspire." (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>)<br><br>"Rupp succeeds in writing a fascinating and at times startling transnational history. . . . The range of this book is extraordinary. . . .

This line of delightfully innovative, animated cartoons ran for ten years and produced such classics as Three Little Pigs, The Tortoise and the Hare, Music Land, and The Old Mill. Silly Symphonies won every Academy Award.<br>From the authors of the prize-winning Walt in Wonderland: The Silent Films of Walt Disney, this richly illustrated volume is a complete history of the Silly Symphonies including detailed entries for all the Symphonies along with a lengthy critical analysis and production history of the series.<br></p><p>"Merritt and Kaufman's <i>Silly Symphonies</i> is a must-have reference for everyone, from Disney aficionados to aspiring animators, anyone interested in animation history. . . . the book is a necessity, a first-class piece of research." --Jerry Beck of Cartoonbrew.comJ.B. Kaufman is an author and film historian who has published extensively on topics including Disney animation and American silent film. He is coauthor, with Russell Merritt, of two essential reference works on Disney animation history: Walt in Wonderland: The Silent Films of Walt Disney (1992; winner of the Kraszna-Krausz Award and the Society for Animation Studies&#39; Norman McLaren-Evelyn Lambart Award, and chosen by The New York Times as a Notable Book of the Year), and Walt Disney&#39;s Silly Symphonies: A Companion to the Classic Cartoon Series (2006).

This book presents six principles practiced within the POW organizational culture that can be used to develop high-performance teams everywhere. The authors offer examples from both the POWs' time in captivity and their later professional lives that identify, in real-life situations, the characteristics necessary for sustainable, high-performance teamwork. The book takes readers inside the mind of James Stockdale, a fighter pilot with a degree in philosophy, who was the senior ranking officer at the Hanoi prison. The theories Stockdale practiced become readily understandable in this book. Drawing parallels between Stockdale's guiding philosophies from the Stoic Epictetus and the principles of modern sports psychology, Peter Fretwell and Taylor Baldwin Kiland show readers how to apply these principles to their own organizations and create a culture with staying power.<br><p>Originally intending their book to focus on Stockdale's leadership style, the authors found that his approach toward completing a mission was to assure that it could be accomplished without him. Stockdale, they explain, had created a mission-centric organization, not a leader-centric organization. He had understood that a truly sustainable culture must not be dependent on a single individual. <br></p><p>At one level, this book is a business school case study. It is also an examination of how leadership and organizational principles employed in the crucible of a Hanoi prison align with today's sports psychology and modern psychological theories and therapies, as well as the training principles used by Olympic athletes and Navy SEALs. Any group willing to apply these principles can move their mission forward and create a culture with staying power--one that outlives individual members.</p></p><p>Peter Fretwell is the general manager of The Classical Network, based in New Jersey. During his MBA studies in strategic leadership, he became convinced the lessons the POWs brought home could benefit other organizations and spent more than seven years researching the topic. He lives in Robbinsville, NJ.<br><br>Taylor Baldwin Kiland, a former naval officer, is a management consultant with a large technology and strategy consulting firm and lives in Alexandria, Virginia. She is the author or coauthor of three books, including <i>Open Doors: Vietnam POWs Thirty Years Later</i>."In addition to the co-authors' combined qualifications, including meticulous research and writing in a lucid, easy-to-grasp narrative style, <i>Lessons From the Hanoi Hilton</i> is a tome, the forerunner of future research into the nature of unï¿½yielding courage and its application to strategic leadership principles." <b><i>-- Leatherneck</i></b><br><br>"Books like this provide a useful guide to complement other work being done to prepare Canadian troops for future challenges. Recommended." --<i><b>Canadian Naval Review</b></i><br><br>"What is your 'tap code'? Any leader or organization should ask that question about the way they communicate. Peter Fretwell and Taylor Kiland lay this out for us as they describe the leadership characteristics of true American heroes. Honor and mission focus should be embedded in everyone's 'tap code.'" <b>--Vice Adm. Cutler Dawson, USN (Ret.), president/CEO of Navy Federal Credit Union</b><br><br>"I can think of no better lens on leadership than the lessons of Adm. Jim Stockdale and how he built a sustainable high-performance culture in the most extreme circumstances. Stockdale epitomized the very highest levels of integrity, honor, discipline, and love; I continually draw strength, resilience, and practical guidance from his inspired example. Learn his lessons, employ them, and you will be better." <b>-- Jim Collins, author or coauthor of six books, including international bestsellers <i>Good to Great, Built to Last</i>, and <i>How the Mighty Fall</i></b><br><br>"I have had experience in a range of public and private sector organizations. In every case a handful of leadership qualities were critical to the success of the organization, and the qualities displayed by the POWs were similar: culture, sustained focus, teamwork, adaptability, and communication. These qualities were evident in the Hanoi Hilton and integral to high-performing commercial organizations everywhere." <b>-- Philip Odeen, former CEO of TRW and member of the board of directors of AES Corporation and Booz Allen Hamilton</b></p><h2>Baltic Mission: #7 A Nathaniel Drinkwater Novel (Mariners Library Fiction Classic)</h2><p>In the seventh tale of the highly acclaimed Drinkwater series, Captain Drinkwater's frigate, HMS ANTIGONE, is ordered to the Baltic Sea in the Spring of 1807 as Napoleon's grip has begun to reach across Europe to the borders of Holy Russia. As country after country falls under the weight of French domination, Captain Nathaniel Drinkwater is faced with the challenges brought about by military disaster and diplomatic intrigue.<br><br>On board the ANTIGONE, Drinkwater is threatened by the seething discontent of his crew and the instability of his drunken first lieutenant. Drinkwater's task is to cooperate with his country's allies and intelligence agents. When a coded message is intercepted, his mission suddenly becomes one of extreme personal danger. As the fate of Europe is being decided, Drinkwater must carry out his mission in the face of his old enemy. This final confrontation brings him to the brink of death.</p><p>Captain Richard Martin Woodman retired in 1997 from a 37-year nautical caree. Woodman&#39;s Nathaniel Drinkwater e series is often compared to the work of the late Patrick O&#39;Brian. Unlike many other modern naval historical novelists, such as C.S. Forester or O&#39;Brian, he has served afloat. He went to sea at the age of sixteen as an indentured midshipman and has spent eleven years in command. His experience ranges from cargo-liners to ocean weather ships and specialist support vessels as well as yachts, square-riggers, and trawlers. Said Lloyd&#39;s List of his work: &#34;As always, Richard Woodman&#39;s story is closely based on actual historical events All this we have come to expect --and he adds that special ambience of colourful credibility which makes his nautical novels such rattling good reads.&#34;This duo of sea adventures spans the historic to the contemporary. Written in 1988, Baltic Mission is an installment in Woodman's Nathaniel Drinkwater series. This episode finds the British sailor on a secret assignment for the crown while Napoleon continues to acquire real estate. Drinkwater is soon at odds with his crew and hamstrung by his drunken first mate. The Endangered Species of this 1992 title are both the British merchant fleet and Capt. John Mackinnon, skipper of the Matthew Flinders. On his last voyage before retirement, Mackinnon, too, finds himself facing a hostile crew, as well as a typhoon and a load of Vietnamese refugees he feels he must rescue and deliver to safety. Now that Patrick O'Brian is gone, this is a solid author to recommend. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Fodor&#39;s Prague: with the Best of the Czech Republic (Full-color Travel Guide)</h2><p>Written by locals, Fodor's travel guides have been offering expert advice for all tastes and budgets for&nbsp;more than 80 years.<br>Offering value, a vibrant nightlife scene, and one of the most beautiful old cities in all of Europe, it's no wonder that Prague is the single most-visited destination in Eastern Europe.

At Oxford he studied bar billiards, ancient Greek agriculture and the care and feeding of small, temperamental Japanese motorcycle engines; interests which led him, perhaps inevitably, to qualify as a solicitor and emigrate to Somerset, where he specialized in death and taxes for seven years before going straight in 1995. He lives in Chard, Somerset, with his wife and daughter.Holt's latest comic fantasy gently twists the reader's mind like a wet dishrag. Polly Mayer thinks she's going crazy: her coffee keeps disappearing, someone else is doing her work, and a dry cleaner vanishes without a trace. Her brother, Don, assumes a rational explanation until he finds an object capable of working magic. Polly's boss, Mr. Huos, knows quite a bit about some ongoing transdimensional skullduggery, but he has no idea who he is or where he came from. Holt (Blonde Bombshell) throws in a highly intelligent pig, a brass ring that isn't, and a "chicken or the egg" riddle with universal ramifications, leaving readers clinging by their fingernails to this rapid-fire tale of a space-time continuum going manic.

Once again he departs from common spiritual assumptions in this intelligent and smoothly written handbook, <i>Freeing the Soul from Fear</i>. One of the more popular attitudes toward the soul is that it's a permanent element of the human being, Sardello explains. As a result, current spiritual guidance often discusses how to reconnect with our impermeable souls through meditation, honoring suffering, and returning to a sense of enchantment.<p> As important as this reconnection is, Sardello believes that it does not go far enough. Rather, we should recognize the soul as a vulnerable entity and commit to strengthening its core. And what weakens a soul the most? Fear. Fundamentally, it contracts the soul's ability to love. And above all else, love comes from the soul--"an experience through which another person, or a spiritual being, or God lives within us," Sardello explains. Chapter by chapter, Sardello examines how perennial fears (such as money, relationships, and death) as well as contemporary fears (Y2K, terrorism, and time collapse) affect the soul. He then offers concrete suggestions for overcoming soul-debilitating fears through love and imagination. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Robert Sardello is a pioneer figure in the study of the soul. He is the author of two previous books, and the cofounder of the School for Spiritual Psychology, which conducts programs worldwide. Sardello is a frequent lecturer at the Dallas Institute of Humanities and Sciences, and across the United States.

So it is in this Christian classic by the late pastor and evangelist A. W. Tozer. He brings the mystics to bear on modern spirituality, grieving the hustle and bustle and calling for a slow, steady gaze upon God. With prophetic vigor and flowing prose, he urges us to replace low thoughts of God with lofty ones, to quiet our lives so we can know God's presence. He reminds us that life apart from God is really no life at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Tozer writes from his knees, a posture fit for presenting the character of God in all its demanding grandeur. "Arise, O sleeper!" is his word to us, and yet if we heed the call, we will see that to arise is not to stand but to kneel before the God of heaven in humble contemplation. To pursue God is to know Him, and in our knowing, be drawn in.</p></p><h2>Traditional Reiki for Our Times: Practical Methods for Personal and Planetary Healing</h2><p>A comprehensive training manual for the introductory levels of this popular healing therapy.<p></p><p><br>ï¿½ Takes the reader step-by-step through traditional Reiki level I and II classes, with comprehensive instruction in the basic hand positions.</p><p><br>ï¿½ Includes photographs and medical illustrations.</p><p><br>ï¿½ Discusses Reiki's origin and purpose, the attunement process, and the many scenarios in which Reiki can provide appropriate healing support.</p><p><br>Reiki, a touch therapy used to recharge and rebalance the body's energy, is quickly joining other complementary therapies like acupuncture and massage in such conventional settings as hospitals, hospices, and psychotherapy practice.

Essays by specialists in the field examine areas that include graphic design&#39;s role as a social force as well as the effect of technological developments and political change.</p><p>This catalog is published to coincide with an exhibit organized by the Walker Art Center. Essays and testimonies from prominent designers attempt to review graphic arts "in aesthetic terms and as a barometer of the society they reflect." As in many other exhibit-related books, this effort does not have enough depth for the scholar yet is not sufficiently enticing to the general reader. Coverage is unfocused, and too many essays are ponderous, particularly in contrast to the candid and enlightening views expressed by the designers. Curiously, the book lacks visual appeal (footnotes dwarf stamp-sized illustrations on some pages). Philip B.

But this announcement marks the start of an operation that will test all her hard-won knowledge and experience&#x2013;and her intelligence and courage&#x2013;as nothing has before. Having analyzed information from her agents, she realizes that there is indeed an imminent terrorist threat. She may even have the invisible&#x2019;s point of entry. But what she cannot draw out of all the &#x201c;chatter&#x201d; is the invisible&#x2019;s identity and intended target. <br><br>With each passing hour, the danger increases. As the desperate hunt continues, it becomes clear that Liz&#x2019;s intuitive skills, her ability to get deep inside her enemy&#x2019;s head, are her best hope for tracking down the terrorist. But will that be enough? And can she succeed in time to avert a disaster?<br><br>Drawing from her experience as the first woman director general of MI5, Stella Rimington gives us a story that is smart, tautly drawn, and suspenseful from first to last. <i>At Risk</i> is a stunning debut novel that plunges us headlong into today&#x2019;s shadowy and fever-pitched battle between terrorism and Intelligence.</p><p>The woman who formerly headed Britain's intelligence service (and what would Ian Fleming have made of that?) comes in from the cold with a smart, clever, and brilliantly paced thriller that seems ripped from the headlines--if not today's, then probably tomorrow's. Liz Carlyle is an agent-runner in MI-5's Joint Counter-Terrorist Group, which is facing the ultimate intelligence nightmare; an "invisible," a terrorist who's an ethnic native of the target country and thus able to cross its borders unchecked and move around its environs unquestioned. All Liz and her team have to go on is the suspicion that a local fisherman who was shot with an unusual armor-piercing gun known to be favored by foreign agents and whose body was found in the restroom of a transport cafï¿½ near a smuggler's beach may have been involved in helping an undercover operative known as "Vengeance Before God" enter England without benefit of passport or visa--a man whose mission, if not his identity, has been the subject of recent intelligence "chatter" from militant Muslim sources. And while Liz thinks she knows who the operative is--an Afghani with forged papers last seen in a German port city--she doesn't have a clue about the "invisible" who's helping him, or the target in their crosshairs.<p> This is a tightly drawn, expertly told tale that wastes few words in describing the shadowy world of the intelligence services, the turf battles and infighting, and even the romantic entanglements that attend the lives of those involved. It marks a promising second career for its author, whose future success will doubtless be much more public than her earlier accomplishments. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Stella Rimington joined Britain&#x2019;s Security Service (MI5) in 1969. During her nearly thirty-year career she worked in all the main fields of the Service&#x2019;s responsibilities&#x2013;counter-subversion, counter-espionage, and counterterrorism&#x2013;and became successively drector of all three branches. Appointed drector general of MI5 in 1992, she was the first woman to hold the post and the first director general whose name was publicly announced on appointment.

Original.</p><p>Together with Pocket Books Star Trek editor John J. Ordover, Robert Greenberger created the overall Gateways concept which forms the basis of the seven-part crossover series.<p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p>There was a real bite in the air, but Will Riker liked watching his exhalations waft through the mostly still air. He and his father had been up before the sun, hiking at least five kilometers to get to this particular spot. The night before, his father, Kyle, had told him they would have to get up that early to stake out the spot for themselves ahead of the competition. It never occurred to the fifteen-year-old that people competed for coveted spots, but it made sense.</p><p>His father had rustled him awake and shoved a mug of hot cocoa into his hand. It felt good cupped in both hands, but he couldn't savor it very long because they had to get moving. Will had put on several layers of clothing, all the while hearing his father bang around the house, getting the last of the gear ready.</p><p>They didn't speak much during the hike; Will was tired and excited but knew Kyle preferred not to disturb nature if at all possible.</p><p>When they arrived at the site, Kyle beamed, thrilled to get there ahead of the other area fishers. It was a small, naturally clear semicircle, obscured from the path by trees. A circle of stones in one corner indicated that many a fisherman had not only caught his dinner, but had cooked it at that spot. The view from the location was spectacular. Will was impressed, even though he had grown up appreciating the natural beauty of Alaska. He let out a low whistle, earning him a broad smile from his father, although it lasted only a moment. Will quickly set up folding chairs, assembled their poles, and found the container with his father's patented bait. Kyle, meantime, set up the makings for a campfire, something they might need later. He also set up a container for their catch and a small transceiver. Will had grown accustomed to the sight of the device. After all, his father worked for the United Federation of Planets and his tactical skills might be needed without advance notice. All too often Will would arrive home from school to a note from his father.</p><p>It had been relatively calm the last few months, so Will was anxious, convinced that his father would be called away any moment.</p><p>They sat side by side, casting and reeling in their lines, neither saying much. As the sun peeked up over the horizon, it painted the lake's surface in dazzling colors. Once the sun cleared the horizon, his father decided it was time for breakfast. He pulled out a few wrapped meal bars, bottles of water, and a bunch of grapes. They ate in continued silence, his father very content with the slow passage of time. Will desperately wished to use the time to start talking, to have a real man-to-man conversation about the years ahead. He was doing well in school and was beginning to seriously consider Starfleet. His father's missions had captured his imagination, and Will was beginning to yearn to see what was beyond this land's snow-capped mountains. Will considered his grades to be good enough, and he wanted his father's perspective. But every time Will wanted to have this conversation, something came up. He had grown frustrated and more than a little angry. Kyle Riker, it seemed to the boy, was just not interested in his future.</p><p>Watching his line, Will grew impatient, and he felt himself starting to fidget. If he was going to spend the day in the chill air, he could at least have a decent conversation with his father. But every time he started to talk, Kyle shushed him. The teen finally gave up and cast at a much faster pace than his father, earning nothing but a scowl.</p><p>As the sun neared its zenith, Will finally felt a tug. It had some force behind it, and he imagined it to be a large fish, easily more than five kilos. He didn't say anything, ready to impress his father with the first catch of the day. Slowly, he reeled in the struggling fish, his pole bending in an impressive arc. Finally, Kyle noticed Will's effort and spoke encouragingly, breaking the uncomfortable silence that had grown over the hours.</p><p>The line, which he had cast out at least twenty-seven meters, was now half that distance, but Will's reeling had slowed. The fish seemed to be winning the struggle. Unwilling to lose his prize, the teen dug in his heels, gritted his teeth, and yanked a bit on the pole to show dinner who was the boss. The prey responded by yanking back, and it was large enough to gain back some distance.</p><p>And that was when Kyle grabbed the pole, his huge hands covering Will's. He used several sharp tugs and then reeled in quickly for several meters before tugging again. Ignoring Will's protests, he took command of the situation. The teen's hands remained trapped. Finally, the catch seemed to give up, and the last few meters were effortless.</p><p><i>Not again,</i> Will thought. His father had done the same thing to him six years ago, and here he was, taking control of the situation again. Dammit, he was fifteen and he was going to bring in the fish or not -- on his own.</p><p>"It's a beauty, Willy," Kyle said as the sheefish came out of the water. Its silver-and-blue body wriggled as Will reached down to remove the hook from its protruding jaw. "Make us a fine dinner."</p><p>Will didn't say a word as he finished removing the hook and dumped the fish into the storage container. The youth seethed, and didn't say anything to his father for the rest of the day. Not that Kyle noticed. He never picked up on Will's anger, or if he did, he never reacted. Once again, his father hadn't let Will complete a task on his own. He was still taking charge and refusing to let the boy grow up.</p><p>Will swore it was the last time he was going to let Kyle Riker control his actions.</p><p>Christine Vale ran a hand through her thick auburn hair, smoothing it down. She had already washed up from her last visit to the surface and changed into a fresh uniform. She refused to beam back down with Aiken's blood splattered all over her. It was their first casualty on Delta Sigma IV and she wanted it to be the last one. She knew, though, that was not likely.</p><p>Leaving her quarters, she refused to acknowledge how tired she felt. Vale would have to exist on adrenaline and caffeine for the moment, since she was needed down below. Sure, she could get some sleep and send down her second-in-command, Jim Peart, but she was their leader. Captain Picard had specifically asked her to oversee the deployment. She didn't want to let the man down. If they were going to suffer, she was going to suffer right beside them. And if she fell, Vale knew Peart was eager to step in and complete the mission.</p><p><i>The mission.</i> She laughed mirthlessly to herself. Vale sent down her teams of security guards to augment the meager numbers of peace officers that were all the police or military support the planet had needed until this week. Her teams had been detailed to help maintain order while the public was panicked over the planet's first murder in a century. That homicide had quickly turned into a string of murders, and then a wave of madness had engulfed the populace. Vale's people were suddenly endangered on all fronts, and she hated it.</p><p>She preferred things to have reasons, patterns she could see and react to. Instead, the citizens of Delta Sigma IV were rapidly losing their inhibitions, acting out without rhyme or reason, and her people were managing, at best, merely a holding action. There was no victory to be had here; they could only minimize the damage.</p><p>Christine took the turbolift to engineering and, emerging, practically walked into the chief engineer himself.</p><p>"Sorry, Geordi," she said, stepping aside. They were approximately the same height, and she looked right into his eyes, which were augmented with cybernetic implants. Their irises narrowed, adjusting the focus, and she found herself staring and quickly looked away.</p><p>"I'm fine, but I think you need some rest," La Forge responded, unperturbed by the penetrating look.</p><p>"Later. I have to get back to the surface. Listen, the people have escalated the violence. It's also become destructive, and I'm going to need some of your people down there. I'm afraid of infrastructure problems, and the last thing we need is to incite further troubles because people can't get fresh water."</p><p>La Forge stroked his bearded chin and nodded in understanding. He turned around and led her to a workstation where he called up duty rosters. Names rolled upward on one screen, color coded by shift. "I'll alert my damage control teams, equip them for general-purpose needs, and have them on standby. You call, they'll come running."</p><p>"And my people will be with them, providing protection. Still, captain's orders are they beam down with sidearms."</p><p>La Forge nodded again, not surprised, but also not pleased that his people would be facing danger. His features softened a bit and he added, "Hey, I'm sorry about Aiken. He was a great kid."</p><p>"Yeah, he was." A kid, fresh out of the Academy, and all his promise snuffed out. The pain refused to budge.</p><p>And she could tell from La Forge's expression that he understood why she was pushing herself to get back below. He'd do the same thing if it were strictly an engineering problem.</p><p>"Listen, I think we need to start by restoring water to Testani."</p><p>"That's the city that burned first," he said, clearly having stayed current despite remaining aboard ship during the mission.</p><p>"Right. The fire in the capital was smaller and was extinguished pretty quickly."</p><p>La Forge went back to studying the roster, his hand back to his beard. "Have you heard from the captain?"</p><p>"Not since he and Counselor Troi returned to the planet," Vale said. She felt herself growing anxious and got ready to leave. But first, she had to get something out in the open.</p><p>"I know you're working with him, but if Nafir screws up and costs me time, I'm going to use him to clean the armory."</p><p>La Forge frowned at that, thought a moment, and responded, "Look, I know he's not at the top of anyone's competency list, Chief, but T'Bonz and I are working with him. He's gotten better since he transferred over. He won't fail you. You have my word on it."</p><p>"Good." She turned to leave and could hear La Forge already ordering his alph...</p></p><h2>Macchu Picchu: The Story of the Amazing Inkas and Their City in the Clouds (Wonders of the World Book)</h2><p><p> Was there ever a people like the Inkas? </p><p> Using slingshots, clubs and stone-tipped spears, this small Andean tribe conquered an area spanning 2,500 miles. Without the use of the wheel, they built a vast and sophisticated network of roads. Without an alphabet, they administered a population of ten million people. With the most primitive of tools, they built cities of stone. </p><p> Machu Picchu is as astonishing as its builders. Set in a remote, inaccessible area of the high Andes, this breathtaking city was never found by the Spanish Conquistadores. It is an untouched example of the genius of the Inkas. </p><p> <b>Machu Picchu</b> tells the story about the rise of the Inkas and the building of this great city. Award-winning author Elizabeth Mann has become justly famous for engrossing narratives that make distant worlds comprehensible and complex engineering feats accessible. In <b>Machu Picchu</b>, these talents are displayed to their fullest. </p><p> Amy Crehore's paintings convey a fabulous world that seems at once intensely real and dream-like. Her luminous pallette is an Inka tapestry unfaded by time. </p><p> <b><i>Wonders of the World</i> series</b> </p><p> The winner of numerous awards, this series is renowned for Elizabeth Mann's ability to convey adventure and excitement while revealing technical information in engaging and easily understood language. The illustrations are lavishly realistic and accurate in detail but do not ignore the human element. Outstanding in the genre, these books are sure to bring even the most indifferent young reader into the worlds of history, geography, and architecture. </p><p> <i>"One of the ten best non-fiction series for young readers."</i><br> - Booklist </p></p><p><p> <b>Elizabeth Mann</b> has written nine Wonders of the World books, an award-winning series. She is former teacher in New York, holds an M.S.E. and is cofounder of Mikaya Press. </p><p> <b>Amy Crehore</b> has a B.F.A. from Virginia Commonwealth University. She illustrates book covers, magazine articles and children's books, and has won awards for her paintings. She lives in Eugene, Oregon. </p>Machu Picchu, the religious site sacred to the Incas (or Inkas as it is spelled here), is the hub around which the rest of the Incas' story plays out. The city, up in the sky and between two mountains, was made out of stone carved with primitive tools. After beginning with the discovery of the city by Hiram Bingham in 1911, Mann goes back in time to introduce the Incas. It is Mann's comfortable text that makes this so special. She ably brings the Inca's complicated society into focus. For instance, she begins with a question: How can we ever really understand a culture so wildly different from our own, where people celebrated rocks as sacred, thought strips of finely woven cloth were more precious than gold, administered a vast empire without knowledge of money or writing, and sacrificed children on mountain peaks? And unlike some nonfiction, this really answers the questions readers want to know. In some detail Mann explains how the various parts of the empire were conquered and shaped into a whole, how roads were built and communication was facilitated, the concept and concrete place that was Machu Picchu, and how the end came for the Incas. Oil paintings by Amy Crehore range from prosaic to arresting (the scene of a bloody battle). More striking are the few photographs: a young, mummified child surrounded by possessions; high in the mountains, Machu Picchu in the mist.

Doolittle is the author of the best-selling <i>The Kentucky Derby; Run for the Roses </i> and <i>The How to Be a Better Bettor Book</i>.<b>Capturing the Kentucky Derby in all its equine glory</b> BY JO ANNE TRIPLETT The Kentucky Derby: Derby Fever, Derby Day, and the Run for the Roses by Bill Doolittle (Carpe Diem Books and Shircliff Publishing; 175 pgs., $50) Much has been written about the Kentucky Derby. After all, Louisvillians have come to substitute the word Derby for spring, as if it is a season on the calendar. That gives us months to discuss a horse race that lasts two minutes. So why should we pay attention to yet another book on the subject? The answer is: for the photography. The Kentucky Derby: Derby Fever, Derby Day, and the Run for the Roses by LEO Weekly s Bill Doolittle is a book full of images by some of the best photographers in the business. Yes, there are many smart words about foals, fashion and food, but this is first and foremost an art book. He planned this book from the beginning to showcase the photography. Some people think real books don t have pictures, but I love to write with illustration, Doolittle said. And nothing comes alive with photography like the Kentucky Derby. The Derby s my subject, and I begin with the idea I m going to grab the best photographers and their most absorbing images, and blend that with words to tell a great big story. For this book I think we have a little different idea about the photography of the Kentucky Derby maybe a little more interested in the art of it than just the journalism. The featured photographers are James Archambeault, Michael Brohm, Skip Dickstein, Dan Dry, Andrew Hancock, Barbara Livingston, Gail Kamenish and John Nation. --Leo Weekly<br><br><b>Put your money on the Kentucky Derby gray?</b> Kirby Adams Horse racing expert and author Bill Doolittle tells The Buzz that eight gray horses have won the Kentucky Derby since Decidedly in 1962.

He lives with his family in Oklahoma.It's May of 1884, and Scotland Yard has just been blown up, the latest attack in the Irish Republican Brotherhood's dynamiting campaign to force Home Rule. Young Welshman Thomas Llewelyn, apprentice to Scottish master detective Cyrus Barker, rushes to the scene of the crime with his mentor in this fast-paced, cleanly written follow-up to <i>Some Danger Involved</i>, Thomas's first historical crime novel featuring the intrepid duo. Despite the resistance of Scotland Yard's ineffective Special Irish Branch, Barker resolves to find and stop the radicals himself. His method: disguise and infiltration of the Fenian faction. Told from Llewelyn's keen and worshipful perspective, the tale traverses London and Europe and chronicles Barker and Llewelyn's undercover adventures and Barker's submersion in the character of German explosives expert Johannes van Rhyn. Llewelyn is brought into the thick of the action as van Rhyn's assistant, Thomas Penrith, an anarchist similarly skilled in bomb making. Together, they're initiated into the violent faction, called the Invincibles, while the younger double agent is enticed by the gorgeous redhead Maire O'Casey, sister of one of the terrorists. Can Llewelyn and Barker play along yet stop the Invincibles before they cripple the English government and bring down London's infrastructure? The action unfolds briskly, and Llewelyn's voice should appeal to boys of all ages. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Many people today take the presence of trees for granted, unaware of their greater significance in Earth&#39;s ecology, their medicinal and nutritional properties, or the veneration bestowed on them by ancient peoples. The Spirit of Trees captures all these elements in a holistic appraisal of Earth&#39;s most influential creation, and will captivate readers through the persuasiveness and passion with which the author portrays his subject. The book explores the relationship of humanity and trees, in terms of the trees&#39; natural assets, humankind&#39;s cultural interpretations of the forest and particular trees, and the ability of trees to inspire, soothe and sustain humankind.</p><p>Fred Hageneder is a harpist, graphic designer and artist whose passion for trees started in his teens.

His life offstage was just as vibrant, and until now no biographer has delivered a complete profile. The One draws on interviews with more than 100 people who knew Brown personally or played with him professionally. Using these sources, award-winning writer RJ Smith draws a portrait of a man whose twisted and amazing life helps us to understand the music he made.</p><p><i>The One</i> delves deeply into the story of a man who was raised in abject-almost medieval-poverty in the segregated South but grew up to earn (and lose) several fortunes. Covering everything from Brown's unconventional childhood (his aunt ran a bordello), to his role in the Black Power movement, which used "Say It Loud (I'm Black and Proud)" as its anthem, to his high-profile friendships, to his complicated family life, Smith's meticulous research and sparkling prose blend biography with a cultural history of a pivotal era.</p><p>At the heart of <i>The One</i> is Brown's musical genius. He had crucial influence as an artist during at least three decades; he inspires pity, awe, and revulsion. As Smith traces the legend's reinvention of funk, soul, R&amp;B, and pop, he gives this history a melody all its own.</p></p><p><b>RJ Smith</b> has been a senior editor at <i>Los Angeles</i> magazine, a contributor to Blender, a columnist for <i>The Village Voice</i>, a staff writer for <i>Spin</i>, and has written for <i>GQ, The New York Times Magazine</i>, and Men's <i>Vogue</i>.

The wound stung like fuck, but it wasn&#x2019;t as bad as some I&#x2019;d had. The blaster bolt came in blind across my ribs, already weakened by the door plating it had to chew through to get to me. Priests, up against the slammed door and looking for a quick gut shot. Fucking amateur night. They&#x2019;d probably caught almost as much pain themselves from the point-blank blowback off the plating. Behind the door, I was already twisting aside. What was left of the charge plowed a long, shallow gash across my rib cage and went out, smoldering in the folds of my coat. Sudden ice down that side of my body and the abrupt stench of fried skin-sensor components. That curious bone-splinter fizzing that&#x2019;s almost a taste, where the bolt had ripped through the biolube casing on the floating ribs.<br><br> Eighteen minutes later, by the softly glowing display chipped into my upper left field of vision, the same fizzing was still with me as I hurried down the lamplit street, trying to ignore the wound.

He blinked wave-tattooed eyelids in a dismissive flutter that said your loss and leaned his tightly muscled frame languidly back into the gloom. I crossed the street and took the corner, tacking between a couple more whores, one a woman, the other of indeterminate gender. The woman was an augment, forked dragon tongue flickering out around her overly prehensile lips, maybe tasting my wound on the night air. Her eyes danced a similar passage over me, then slid away. On the other side, the cross-gender pro shifted its stance slightly and gave me a quizzical look but said nothing. Neither was interested. The streets were rain-slick and deserted, and they&#x2019;d had longer to see me coming than the doorway operator. I&#x2019;d cleaned up since leaving the citadel, but something about me must have telegraphed the lack of business opportunity.<br><br> At my back, I heard them talking about me in Stripjap.

From the newly built hoverloader dock down at the Kompcho end of town it was less than a thousand kilometers, straight-line distance, to the shores of New Hokkaido, and the &#x2019;loaders were running day and night. Outside of an airdrop, there is no faster way to get across the Andrassy Sea. And on Harlan&#x2019;s World, you don&#x2019;t go up in the air if you can possibly avoid it.

The pipe houses on Muko had just turned out and their synapse-fried patrons had met late-shift dockworkers coming up through the decayed quiet of the warehouse quarter. More than enough reason for violence. Now a dozen badly coordinated figures stumbled back and forth in the street, flailing and clawing inexpertly at each other while a gathered crowd shouted encouragement. One body already lay inert on the fused-glass paving, and someone else was dragging their body, a limb&#x2019;s length at a time, out of the fray, bleeding. Blue sparks shorted off a set of overcharged power knuckles; elsewhere light glimmered on a blade. But everyone still standing seemed to be having a good time, and there were no police as yet.<br><br> Yeah, part of me jeered. Probably all too busy up the hill right now.<br><br> I skirted the action as best I could, shielding my injured side. Beneath the coat, my hands closed on the smooth curve of the last hallucinogen grenade and the slightly sticky hilt of the Tebbit knife.<br><br> Never get into a fight if you can kill quickly and be gone.<br><br> Virginia Vidaura&#x2014;Envoy Corps trainer, later career criminal and sometime political activist. Something of a role model for me, though it was several decades since I&#x2019;d last seen her. On a dozen different worlds, she crept into my mind unbidden, and I owed that ghost in my head my own life a dozen times over. This time I didn&#x2019;t need her or the knife. I got past the fight without eye contact, made the corner of Pencheva, and melted into the shadows that lay across the alley mouths on the seaward side of the street. The timechip in my eye said I was late.<br><br> Pick it up, Kovacs. According to my contact in Millsport, Plex wasn&#x2019;t all that reliable at the best of times, and I hadn&#x2019;t paid him enough to wait long.<br><br> Five hundred meters down and then left into the tight fractal whorls of Belacotton Kohei Section, named centuries ago for the habitual content and the original owner-operator family whose warehouse frontages walled the curving maze of alleys. With the Unsettlement and the subsequent loss of New Hokkaido as any kind of market, the local belaweed trade pretty much collapsed and families like Kohei went rapidly bankrupt. Now the grime-filmed upper-level windows of their faï¿½ades peered sadly across at each other over gape-mouthed loading bay entrances whose shutters were all jammed somewhere uncommitted between open and closed.<br><br> There was talk of regeneration, of course, of reopening units like these and retooling them as deCom labs, training centers, and hardware storage facilities. Mostly, it was still just talk&#x2014;the enthusiasm had kindled on the wharf-line units facing the hoverloader ramps farther west, but so far it hadn&#x2019;t spread farther in any direction than you could trust a wirehead with your phone. This far off the wharf and this far east, the chitter of Mecsek finance was still pretty inaudible.<br><br> The joys of trickledown.<br><br> Belacotton Kohei Nine Point Twenty-six showed a faint glow in one upper window, and the long restless tongues of shadows in the light that seeped from under the half-cranked loading bay shutter gave the building the look of a one-eyed, drooling maniac. I slid to the wall and dialed up the synthetic sleeve&#x2019;s auditory circuits for what they were worth, which wasn&#x2019;t much. Voices leaked out into the street, fitful as the shadows at my feet.<br><br> &#x201c;&#x2014;telling you, I&#x2019;m not going to hang around for that.&#x201d;<br><br> It was a Millsport accent, the drawling metropolitan twang of Harlan&#x2019;s World Amanglic dragged up to an irritated jag. Plex&#x2019;s voice, muttering below sense-making range, made soft provincial counterpoint. He seemed to be asking a question.<br><br> &#x201c;How the fuck would I know that? Believe what you want.&#x201d; Plex&#x2019;s companion was moving about, handling things. His voice faded back in the echoes of the loading bay. I caught the words kaikyo, matter, a chopped laugh. Then again, coming closer to the shutter, &#x201c;&#x2014;matters is what the family believes, and they&#x2019;ll believe what the technology tells them. Technology leaves a trail, my friend.&#x201d; A sharp coughing and indrawn breath that sounded like recreational chemicals going down. &#x201c;This guy is fucking late.&#x201d;<br><br> I frowned. Kaikyo has a lot of meanings, but they all depend on how old you are. Geographically, it&#x2019;s a strait or a channel. That&#x2019;s early-Settlement-years use, or just hypereducated, kanji-scribbling, First Families pretension. This guy didn&#x2019;t sound First Family, but there was no reason he couldn&#x2019;t have been around back when Konrad Harlan and his well-connected pals were turning Glimmer VI into their own personal backyard. Plenty of DH personalities still on stack from that far back, just waiting to be downloaded into a working sleeve. Come to that, you wouldn&#x2019;t need to resleeve more than half a dozen times, end-to-end, to live through the whole of Harlan&#x2019;s World&#x2019;s human history anyway. It&#x2019;s still not much over four centuries, Earth-standard, since the colony barges made planetfall.<br><br> Envoy intuition twisted about in my head. It felt wrong. I&#x2019;d met men and women with centuries of continuous life behind them, and they didn&#x2019;t talk like this guy. This wasn&#x2019;t the wisdom of ages, drawling out into the Tekitomura night over pipe fumes.<br><br> On the street, scavenged into the argot of Stripjap a couple of hundred years later, kaikyo means a contact who can shift stolen goods. A covert flow manager. In some parts of the Millsport Archipelago, it&#x2019;s still common usage. Elsewhere, the meaning is shifting to describe aboveboard financial consultants.<br><br> Yeah, and farther south it means a holy man possessed by spirits, or a sewage outlet. Enough of this detective shit. You heard the man&#x2014;you&#x2019;re late.<br><br> I got the heel of one hand under the edge of the shutter and hauled upward, locking up the tidal rip of pain from my wound as well as the synthetic sleeve&#x2019;s nervous system would let me. The shutter ratcheted noisily to the roof. Light fell out into the street and all over me.<br><br> &#x201c;Evening.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Jesus!&#x201d; The Millsport accent jerked back a full step. He&#x2019;d been only a couple of meters away from the shutter when it went up.<br><br> &#x201c;Tak.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hello, Plex.&#x201d; My eyes stayed on the newcomer. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s the tan?&#x201d;<br><br> By then I already knew. Pa...</p><h2>John Elias</h2><p>North Wales in the early part of the nineteenth century provides a striking instance of the way in which a spiritual revolution can change the whole direction of a people and a society. Equally striking was the agency which brought the prevailing religious indifference and lawlessness to an end: it was the preaching of the gospel by men without position or influence like John Elias. Under the preaching of Elias, the outlook of thousands was permanently changed. They not only heard of the crucifixion of Christ, but felt that they had seen it. &#39;I felt, said one hearer, &#39;as if the earth shook for miles around me.&#39; This account by Edward Morgan traces the life and ministry of Elias from his first religious impressions until the day when 10,000 attended his funeral in Anglesey, the scene of most of his labours. Here, in days of revival, forty-four chapels were built in forty years. To Elias&#39; life and the lessons to be drawn from it are added his letters and other papers originally published as a separate volume. Previously published by the Trust in this form in 1973, the Life, Letters and Essays of John Elias is now reckoned among Christian classics.</p><p>Edward Morgan (1783-1869) was born at Pyle in Glamorgan. He graduated from Jesus College, Oxford, in 1806 and served various parishes in England. He was appointed to the vicarage of Syston, Leicester, in 1814, to which was added the nearby vicariate of Ratcliffe-on-the-Wreake in 1818, and in these rural charges he remained until his death in June 1869.<br>Morgan wrote extensively, particularly concerning the work of God in his native Wales. His published works amounted to nineteen volumes, including biographies of Daniel Rowland, William Williams, Thomas Charles and many others. He was the editor of the letters and papers of Thomas Charles published by the Trust as Thomas Charles Spiritual Counsels, and wrote the account of the life of John Elias, which appears in John Elias: Life and Letters.</p><h2>Futurama : Conquers the Universe</h2><p>Brings Bender, Fry, Leela, and the rest of the Planet Express workforce to Bongo Comics, publishers of the Simpsons comics and other fine graphic literature.</p><p></p><h2>The Unknown God: W.T. Smith and the Thelemites</h2><p>The first documentary study of Aleister Crowley's contemporary followers in North America, told through the life of their de facto leader, Wilfred Talbot Smith (1885-1957). Smith, the unacknowledged offspring of a prominent English family, emigrated to Canada where he met Charles Stansfeld Jones and through him, the works of Aleister Crowley. Although Crowley and Smith met only once, their twenty year correspondence proved to be a major link to the few and the faithful attracted to Crowley's work in the United States and Canada. Smith's spiritual life centered first on the initiatic structure of the Order of the A.ï¿½.A.ï¿½., complemented by the emerging fraternal and social schemes of the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO). Smith followed Jones into a few long-forgotten movements like the Universal Brotherhood and the Psychomagian Society, but he declined membership in C.F. Russell's Choronzon Club.<p> &nbsp;To promulgate the Crowleyan teachings, in 1934 Smith incorporated his own "Church of Thelema"--known to Los Angeles newspaper readers as the "Purple Cult." The following year he initiated OTO activity in Los Angeles which attracted its own cast of occult characters. Smith's life reached a strange conclusion when Crowley, taking a page from Louis Bromfield's novel, THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS ANNIE SPRAGG, which explored "the twin mysteries of love and religion and the confusion that lies between" and combining it with a reading of Smith's natal chart, sent him off on a retreat to determine which God he was incarnating. It was a journey from which Frater 132 never returned...</p><p> THE UNKNOWN GOD is a fascinating and complex human story, intimately interwoven with the lives of most of Crowley's disciples in the United States including C.F. Russell Jane Wolfe, Max R. Schneider, Jack Parsons, Louis T. Culling, Frederic Mellinger and Grady L. McMurtry as well as occult teachers like H. Spencer Lewis (AMORC) Paul Foster Case (BOTA), and Wayne Walker (OM), Hollywood actors such as John Carradine and even the founder of the Mattachine Society, Harry Hay. Students of 19th and 20th century esoteric movements, including the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the Theosophical Society and the Crowley-derived organizations, will find THE UNKNOWN GOD worth reading.</p></p><p>THE UNKNOWN GOD is a fascinating and complex human story, intimately interwoven with the lives of most of Crowley&#39;s American disciples including C.F.

Born in Florence to nomadic American parents who were ever in search of a better health spa, he in his turn landed in Paris, then London. An exile among exiles, he was temperamentally suited for a role he dislikedportrait artist. This sumptuously illustrated collection includes essays that are as psychologically subtle as Sargent's own portraits. They explore his "dab-and-spot" experiments with impressionism, his surprisingly dark vision of Venice, his seldom-seen pencil and charcoal drawings and virtuoso watercolors. One piece, "Portrait of the Artist As Dorian Gray," argues that Sargent shared with Oscar Wilde and Henry James the belief in art as an activity for asserting one's personality and gaining mastery over experience. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.A lavishly illustrated group of scholarly essays published by the Whitney Museum as the catalog of the retrospective of this 19th-century Euro-American society painter. Hills contributes three fine studies on Sargent's style and sensibility, the late subject pictures, and draftsmanship. Other specialists cover Sargent in Venice, in Paris and London, his Impressionism, the late portraits, and the watercolors. Stanley Olson's contribution on Sargent's family is the most outstanding. Olson remarks that at his birth the artist received "his mother's well-thumbed Baedeker , and not a silver spoon, for he began his life as he ended itas a tourist."

Julian the Apostate, nephew of Constantine the Great, was one of the brightest yet briefest lights in the history of the Roman Empire. A military genius on the level of Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great, a graceful and persuasive essayist, and a philosopher devoted to worshiping the gods of Hellenism, he became embroiled in a fierce intellectual war with Christianity that provoked his murder at the age of thirty-two, only four years into his brilliantly humane and compassionate reign. A marvelously imaginative and insightful novel of classical antiquity, Julian captures the religious and political ferment of a desperate age and restores with blazing wit and vigor the legacy of an impassioned ruler.</p><p>&#x201c;High entertainment.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review<br></i><br>&#x201c;A subtle, provoking, enthralling book. . . .

Could versions of books like <i>The Ghosts of Belfast</i> or <i>Collusion</i> have been written while the Troubles were ongoing?</p> <p><b>Stuart Neville:</b> No, I definitely couldn't have written <i>The Ghosts of Belfast</i> twenty, fifteen or maybe even ten years ago. I've long argued that the best fiction, on page or screen, about any conflict doesn't come along until the conflict is over. We didn't get movies like <i>The Deer Hunter</i> and <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> until the Vietnam War was over, for example. In a more practical sense, <i>Ghosts</i> was more about the aftermath of conflict than the conflict itself, and what happens to those who fought when they're no longer needed by the men of power.</p> <p><b>Connolly:</b> <i>Collusion</i> was very much a sequel to the first book. Do you think that presented difficulties for readers new to your work? </p><p><b>Neville:</b> Almost all of the comments I've heard have been positive, even for those people who read the books out of order. <i>Collusion</i> is, as you point out, a continuation of the first book, but people seem to be happy to take it on its own terms. I think it works because it's in part a mystery where the protagonist, Jack Lennon, has to figure out what went on in the first book, so if you've not read <i>Ghosts</i>, you follow the mystery with him.</p> <p><b>Connolly:</b> Did you perceive a difference in the way the books were received in Britain, Ireland and the U.S.?</p> <p><b>Neville:</b> Yes, to my surprise. I think the first book in particular was taken more seriously in the U.S., perhaps seen as a more literary thriller, whereas it was seen as more commercial in the U.K. and Ireland. I've been constantly surprised how universally well the first book was received within Ireland, across all sections of society. I had been expecting some flak from certain quarters because of the politics of it, but that never materialized to any significant extent.</p> <p><b>Connolly:</b> You've spoken of the new book in terms of a departure from what has gone before it. In what way does it differ from the earlier novels?</p> <p><b>Neville:</b> For <i>Stolen Souls</i>, I really wanted to take a step away from the heavier political aspects of the first two books and concentrate on writing a thriller whose only purpose was to scare the hell out of the reader. I wanted it to be fast, hitting hard from the first sentence and not letting up until the end, which I hope I've achieved.</p> <p><b>Connolly:</b> There were obviously elements of <i>Collusion</i> that took place outside Ireland. Do you feel in any way constrained by being regarded as a writer from Northern Ireland? Would you be tempted to look outside the province for plots and material?</p> <p><b>Neville:</b> I'll go wherever the story leads me. When I first started writing, I didn't want to write about Northern Ireland, and I especially didn't want to write about the Troubles, but then the idea for <i>The Ghosts of Belfast</i> presented itself, and that was that. My next book, <i>Dweller on the Threshold</i>, mostly takes place south of the border in the Republic of Ireland, which is a small change of location, but its action actually spans Europe because that's what the story demanded. I have plans for a future Jack Lennon novel which may have more international locations, but that won't be for a while yet.</p> <p><b>Connolly:</b> Do you feel that you and a handful of other writers from Northern Ireland are essentially creating a genre as you go, given the absence of models for Irish mystery fiction, and mystery fiction from Northern Ireland in particular?</p> <p><b>Neville:</b> Crime writers from anywhere other than London, LA or New York tend to get labels put on them, like Tartan Noir for the Scots and Emerald Noir for the Irish. I tried to coin the term Norn Noir for Northern Irish crime fiction, but it didn't stick. I don't really know if they qualify as genres, though. I guess there are stylistic tics that'll separate out writers from one place or another, but does that make it a genre unto itself? Colin Bateman was the trailblazer for Northern Irish crime fiction, but I don't think anyone who followed him has been able to ape his style. Rather, I think writers like Adrian McKinty have carved out their own styles.</p> <p><b>Connolly:</b> You're perhaps the best example of an author who used electronic publishing as a way into mainstream publishing. How did that come about? Does it give you a degree of comfort with the changes that are taking place in the industry, or are you concerned by them?</p> <p><b>Neville:</b> Technology moves so fast, I think I'm behind the curve already. Yes, it was through blogging and selling short stories to online zines that got my foot in the door. Here we are just three or four years later and everyone has moved on from blogging to Facebook and Twitter. At the same time, there seems to be a lot of fearmongering and panic in certain quarters, and a gold rush mentality in others. Me, I'm going to wait and see.</p>Stuart Neville is the author of two previous books, <i>Collusion</i> and <i>The Ghosts of Belfast</i>, winner of the 2010 <i>LA Times</i> Book Prize and the Spinetingler Award for Best First Novel, and a finalist for the Macavity Award, the Barry Award, and Anthony Award for Best First Novel.

Caroline is quiet; Martha says whatever comes to mind. But when two rich girls are mean to Martha, guess who stands up for her-- Caroline!</p><p>The Caroline Chapter Books are part of an ongoing series of Little House Chapter Books.</p></p><p><p>Maria D. Wilkes first read the Little House books as a young girl and has been fascinated by pioneer history ever since. She did extensive research on the Quiner, Ingalls, and Wilder families, studied original sources and family letters and diaries, and worked in close consultation with several historians and the Laura Ingalls Wilder estate as she wrote the Caroline Years books. She lives in New Jersey with her husband, Peter, and her daughters, Grace and Natalie.</p><p>Chapter 1 </p><p>Sisters Caroline and Martha Quiner were sisters. They lived in Brookfield, Wisconsin, in a little frame house with their mother and grandmother. They had two big brothers named Joseph and Henry, a little brother named Thomas, and a little sister named Eliza.</p><p>Caroline was six years old. She wore her brown hair in one long braid down her back. Martha was eight and wore her brown hair in two long braids. Caroline liked getting up early to help Mother with the morning chores. Martha liked to sleep as late as she could. One thing they both didn't like was helping Mother on wash day.</p><p>On wash day, Caroline and Martha had to carry buckets of water all the way from the well to the kitchen. Mother needed a lot of water to do the whole week's washing. Carrying water was hard work. The buckets were very heavy. Caroline always tried to be careful. She didn't like to spill any water on her apron. But Martha's water bucket tipped and spilled with every step.</p><p>"When I'm a grown lady," Martha said grumpily as they carried their buckets across the yard, "I'm going to have so many dresses, I'll never have to wash them! I'll just wear a different one every day."</p><p>Caroline loved pretty dresses. But right now, all she could think about were her aching fingers.</p><p>"Do your fingers hurt, Martha?" she asked.</p><p>"My fingers . . . and my hands, and my arms!" Martha grumbled.</p><p>"Maybe this will be the last bucket," Caroline said quietly. She did not want Mother to hear her complaining. Mother worked so very hard now that Father was gone. The year before, Father had sailed away on a big boat and he had never come back. Mother said Father was in heaven. Caroline missed him very much.</p><p>Finally, Caroline and Martha reached the kitchen. They set their buckets down in front of the hearth.</p><p>"Goodness glory, Martha!" Mother laughed. "If you spill any more water on your apron, I won't have to bother washing it!"</p><p>Martha wrinkled her nose and looked down at her apron.</p><p>"I can't keep all the water from splashing out of the bucket! No matter how hard I try!" she cried.</p><p>"Carry a little less at a time, dear," Mother said gently.</p><p>Mother poured the buckets into the big iron pot that hung from a hook over the fire.</p><p>"That's enough water," Mother told Caroline and Martha. "Now you girls may carry in wood for the fire.</p><p>"Caroline rubbed her sore hands together. She wasn't sure if she liked carrying wood any more than she liked carrying water. But Martha was sure.</p><p>"Come on!" Martha cried, tugging on Caroline's sleeve.</p><p>The girls rushed outside. At the woodpile, Joseph and Henry were busy chopping wood.</p><p>"Are you sure you two are strong enough to carry the wood?" Henry asked with a grin. He was only a little bit older than Martha, and he liked to tease her.</p><p>"I'm almost as strong as you!" Martha called back. She knelt down and began piling kindling and wood chips into her apron. "I'll show that Henry," she whispered.</p><p>Caroline let out a little sigh and began filling her apron, too. Martha did not care about getting dirty, but Caroline did. All day Caroline had tried so hard to keep clean. Now Mother would have to wash her apron, too.</p><p>Back and forth across the yard Caroline and Martha went with their aprons full of kindling. Each time Martha gathered another load of wood, she stuck her chin out at Henry. Caroline was tired and wanted to rest, but Martha wanted to show Henry how much wood they could carry.</p><p>Finally the water in the pot was steaming and bubbling. Mother called the girls into the kitchen.</p><p>"I'm ready to begin the wash," she said.Martha let out a long sigh.</p><p>"Already, Mother?"</p><p>"Your dress will be clean and dry in no time," Mother said cheerfully. "Please go upstairs and practice your Bible verses while you're waiting.</p><p>"Every week on wash day, Caroline felt extra sorry for her big sister. Martha only had one everyday dress. So every wash day, Martha had to climb into bed and stay there until her dress and apron were cleaned. Usually Caroline didn't like to wear Martha's old dresses, but on wash day, she was glad that she had two everyday dresses to wear, even if they were hand-me-downs. At least she didn't have to stay in bed while Mother washed.</p><p>"Oh, why is it always sunny on the day Mother does the wash?" Martha whispered as she and Caroline climbed the stairs to their bedroom. "I want to be outside today! I don't want to sit in bed and practice silly verses."</p><p>"The sunshine will help dry your dress fast," Caroline said, trying to make Martha feel better.</p><p>Caroline waited for Martha to undress, and then she rushed downstairs with the clothes in a bundle.For the rest of the morning, Caroline helped Mother with the washing. At noontime, Mother stood up and wiped her hand across her brow.</p><p>"Time for dinner," she said with a smile. "We'll finish the rest of the clothes after we eat.</p><p>"Mother's face was pink from the heat. Long strands of her black hair had come down from her bun. Caroline thought she looked pretty.</p><p>For dinner, Grandma had made plenty of baked beans and pork, sweet potatoes, cheese, and corn bread. The fresh, warm smells filled the whole house. Mother fixed a plate for Martha, and Caroline carefully carried it up the stairs.</p><p>When Martha heard footsteps, she quickly began reciting her Bible verses.</p><p>"It's only me," Caroline whispered. "Here's your dinner.</p><p>"Martha sat up in bed. "Is Mother almost finished washing my dress?" she asked.</p><p>"Almost," Caroline answered. "Once the water boils again, she'll start rinsing all the clothes."</p><p>"Rinse?" Martha cried. "You mean the clothes aren't even rinsed yet?" </p></p><h2>Survival Skills of the North American Indians</h2><p>Identifies wild, Indian food plants and provides detailed information on Indian tools, weapons, traps, fishing techniques, homes, clothing, medicine, transportation, tanning procedures, basket making, and pottery</p><p><b>Peter Goodchild</b> is the author of <i>The Spark in the Stone</i> and <i>Raven Tales</i> and is a lifelong student of Native American skills and culture.

Profusely illustrated, Skywatching has been well designed to advise and encourage the potential "backyard" astronomer. Brief background explanations speed the reader through relevant topics such as the history of astronomy, types of stars and other celestial objects of interest to skywatchers, and techniques and equipment for the amateur. The core of the book features a series of seasonal sky charts to be used in conjunction with a generous alphabetical arrangement of constellation maps. Viewpoints for both northern and southern hemispheres are represented, with the sky's offerings accessible through binoculars, small telescope, and the naked eye clearly set out for any approximate latitude and time of year. Although the ever-varying motions of the planets are necessarily omitted, the creators of this guidebook have supplied more than enough inspiration to send readers out in search of a sufficiently dark, unobstructed view of the night sky.

It is the time we each come to, that moment of self-assessment, when we wonder if we have taken the right path. Sometime in our 30s, 40s, or 50s, the dreams that haven&#39;t materialized for us, the goals we haven&#39;t achieved, loom before us--and we recognize they may never happen. We stand at a crossroads and ask, Who have I become? How did I get here? Is this who I really am and want to be? How can I reinvent myself so the rest of my journey matters? In Second Wind for the Second Half, Patrick Morley offers insight for men and women alike. Here is wisdom for all who have reached a turning point midway through life and wonder where to go to find a new and better journey. Raising issues common to all of us during the middle years, Second Wind for the Second Half offers practical ideas to make peace with the changes that occur, and shows readers how to pass through to a deeper, lasting sense of significance and joy. When life loses its zip and suddenly what was meaningful seems meaningless, it can become a golden opportunity to examine our assumptions about our own lives. Second Wind for the Second Half shows how this process of reevaluation and reinvention of ourselves can spur us on to find new and promising pathways for a more fulfilling, joyous life.Patrick Morley is a business leader, best-selling author, speaker, and one of the pioneers in the Christian Men&#x2019;s Movement.

She lives in Hawaii.Chapter 1&nbsp;<br>That night, the night I first met Scipion du Roure, all I could think of was the ball and my gown of pale yellow silk and the garland of fragrant white flowering jasmine Euphemia had woven into my hair. I hummed as I dressed, practicing walking in the wide skirt on its stiff wire frame and glancing at my reflection in the pier glass that stood in the middle of my bedroom.<br>My eyes were bright, my skin warm and glowing in the candlelight. I remember thinking, I am beautiful. Every man at the ball will want to dance with me.<br>I was living with my parents in Martinique on the plantation known as Les Trois-Ilets, the Three Little Islands. The year was 1778. My poor harassed father Joseph Tascher was drinking far too much and going deeper and deeper into debt, and my mother and grandmother were hounding him relentlessly. I tried to ignore their arguing&#x2014;they argued a lot&#x2014;and keep my thoughts on the ball to come. But the raised voices were hard to ignore.<br>&#x201c;You must ask your brother for another loan,&#x201d; my mother was insisting. &#x201c;Do not wait. Ride to Fort-Royal tonight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Gladly, my dear,&#x201d; was my father&#x2019;s wry response. &#x201c;Only I know what his answer will be. No more loans. Not until I agree to make him co-owner of Les Trois-Ilets, and name his son as my sole heir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your sole heir, indeed,&#x201d; sniffed my grandmother. &#x201c;If you were man enough you&#x2019;d have sons instead of daughters.&#x201d;<br>My grandmother Catherine des Sannois, who was born plain Catherine Brown on a farm in Dundreary, had the fiery temper of her Irish ancestors and never lost a chance to criticize my highborn father.<br>&#x201c;And if my wife did her duty she would give me sons. The fault is hers.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How dare you speak to me in that way when I nearly died giving birth to the last one?&#x201d; My mother rose from her chair and approached my father accusingly. &#x201c;And how dare you show such disrespect for poor Catherine, and her in her grave these past two months!&#x201d; My sister Catherine, who had been frail and sickly most of her life, had finally succumbed to a fever and was buried in the little church on our plantation.<br>&#x201c;I wish to heaven you were in your graves too,&#x201d; I heard my father mutter as he turned aside. &#x201c;Then we could all have some peace.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Peace? peace? You talk of peace, when everything you do upsets the rest of us?&#x201d; My grandmother continued her harangue. &#x201c;You neglect your daughters. Neither of them is betrothed. You neglect your wife. How many mistresses do you have there in Fort-Royal? Three? Six? And with how many octoroon bastards who look like you? Worst of all you neglect this plantation, which my husband and I gave you, worthless idler that you are, so that your family would not starve. Look at it! Where are the cane fields? Returned to the wild. Where are the slaves? Run away, most of them. What do you have to show for seventeen years of ownership? A fine plantation in ruins! That&#x2019;s what! And a family on the brink of starvation!&#x201d;<br>Father took out his silver flask and drank from it, his lined face weary and his thin, greying hair coming loose from his untidily tied bag wig. In that moment, while there was a pause in the combat, I came forward to show off my gown.<br>I walked slowly past father, mother and Grandma Sannois. I saw a light come into my father&#x2019;s eyes as he watched me, and knew it for a gleam of admiration. My grandmother nodded. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time she was betrothed,&#x201d; she said curtly. &#x201c;Past time.&#x201d; My mother looked me over critically, from the top of my garlanded head to the gleaming bows on my yellow satin slippers.<br>&#x201c;Watch out for the men,&#x201d; was all she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>the narrow, twisting torchlit streets of Fort-Royal shone yellow under the moon as our carriage&#x2014;really a cart, with a makeshift canvas top tied on to shield us from rain&#x2014;climbed the hillside toward my uncle&#x2019;s imposing house above Fort-Royal Bay. My uncle Robert Tascher was commandant of the harbor, and he and his family lived well. Some five hundred guests, drawn from the best society&#x2014;the Grands Blancs, as we were known, the Great Whites, or Europeans&#x2014;were to attend the ball on this night, and I was among those fortunate enough to be invited.<br>I was chaperoned by my Aunt Rosette, my father and Uncle Robert&#x2019;s tremulous, withdrawn spinster sister. She was the perfect companion, all but silent and extremely unprepossessing in her old green gown with the faded crimson rosettes&#x2014;the same one she wore to every party and ball. She never interfered with my good times. I knew she admired and envied me, for she had never been good-looking and indeed she seemed to fade into the wallpaper in any room she entered.<br>The air was humid, and my yellow silk gown was already damp with perspiration when we arrived at the imposing front gate of Uncle Robert&#x2019;s mansion. The curls my maid Euphemia had arranged across my broad forehead with such care clung wetly to my skin.<br>Once inside, I drank thirstily from the cup of rum punch a tall African servant handed to me, and asked for another. I sat down by an open window and let the music of the orchestra, the murmur of voices, the susurration of the bright swaying gowns and the welcome play of the wind off the bay wash over me.<br>I did not sit there long. Soon a young man came up to me and asked me to dance, and then another and another. I danced every dance, I remember, and as the evening wore on I began to feel dizzy when I turned and twirled in the steps of the quadrille and minuet. I was glad when there came a lull in the music and some of the guests began to leave.<br>Then, before I knew it, a man in a smart uniform was bending down toward me, and extending his hand. I looked up, and saw his fine grey eyes fixed on me, a mischievous smile on his full lips.<br>&#x201c;Lieutenant Scipion du Roure, mademoiselle. Will you do me the honor of dancing with me?&#x201d;<br>I floated, I walked on air, I melted into his arms&#x2014;and all too soon our dance was at an end.<br>&#x201c;Come for a walk with me,&#x201d; he whispered as he kissed my gloved hand in parting. &#x201c;Meet me by the mango tree in half an hour.&#x201d; There was a huge old mango beside the veranda of Uncle Robert&#x2019;s mansion. I had no doubt that was the tree he meant. I felt a tingle of anticipation, for it never occurred to me not to meet him.<br>&#x201c;Watch out for the men,&#x201d; my mother had cautioned me, but in that moment I forgot her warning. My only thought was, how will I slip away? My Aunt Rosette, my self-effacing chaperone, had been watching me dance all evening long while eating from a plate of vanilla custards. As I went up to her I saw that she had eaten too many, and looked ill. As I approached she hastily put her plate down and wiped her mouth with the back of one ungloved hand.<br>&#x201c;You look tired, Aunt Rosette. I&#x2019;m sure Uncle Robert could find you somewhere to lie down.&#x201d;<br>She gave me a sharp look. &#x201c;You know I cannot leave as long as you are here. You cannot be abandoned without a relative to watch over you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But I won&#x2019;t be abandoned. Aunt Louise is here.&#x201d; As hostess of the ball my aunt was, of course, present in the large room, though hundreds of guests milled about between her and me.<br>A look of pain crossed Aunt Rosette&#x2019;s face, and she put her hand over her stomach.<br>&#x201c;You need some oil of wintergreen, Aunt Rosette&#x2014;and now, without delay.&#x201d; I reached for her free hand and she let me lead her down a corridor to where a clutch of servants stood, out of sight of the dancers in the ballroom, watching the festivities through a partially open door. Among the servants I recognized Denise, the housekeeper.<br>Over Aunt Rosette&#x2019;s increasingly feeble protests Denise and I persuaded her to rest in a darkened room and to drink an infusion of oil of wintergreen. Leaving her in Denise&#x2019;s care I hurried back to the ballroom and out along the veranda toward the garden. The huge mass of the great mango tree, heavy with green fruit, its wide branches gleaming in the silvery moonlight, stood out from the tall palms and flowering tamarisks around it. At the foot of the tree stood Scipion du Roure in his smart blue naval uniform, leaning nonchalantly against the trunk, arms folded. He smiled as he watched me approach. As I came up to him he held out his hand.<br>&#x201c;There you are, my lovely Bird of Paradise.&#x201d;<br>I stripped off my gloves and took his outstretched hand. His smile was languid, seductive&#x2014;though I did not know those words at the age of fifteen. I knew only that I was excited to be meeting him, and that our meeting was all the more exciting to me because it was forbidden. For us to be alone together in the dark garden, with only the sleepy birds and croaking frogs for company, was outside the rules of conduct for Grands Blancs. I liked breaking the rules. And I liked the name he called me. Bird of Paradise.<br>We walked hand in hand along a stonework path that led to the shore of the wide bay. As a child I had walked that path many times before, with my cousins, on our way to the beach to swim. But we had always gone in the daytime, never at night. I had never before seen the silver path made by the moon&#x2019;s reflection in the waters of the broad bay, or felt the balm of the cool night air on my fevered cheeks. And I had never before inhaled such a powerful scent from the night-blooming jasmine that lined the path on either side, a scent that put the fragrance of my own jasmine garlan...</p><h2>Hush Money</h2><p>Spenser has his hands full when he takes on two cases at once. In the first, a high-minded university might be hiding a killer within a swamp of political correctness. And in the other, Spenser comes to the aid of a stalking victim, only to find himself the unwilling object of the woman&#39;s dangerous affection.</p><p>Sometimes a detective's life is all work for no pay. As a favor to his buddy Hawk, Spenser agrees to investigate a man unjustly denied tenure. Then Spenser's girlfriend, Susan, asks Spenser to help stop a stalker. Plenty of work, sure, but all done pro bono. "Two cases at a time. I thought about having 'Master Sleuth' added to my business cards." As the cases unfold, Spenser (and Hawk) charm and batter their way past policemen, stockbrokers, hit men, white supremacists, an unstable woman, and a stuffy tenure committee. Author Robert B.

But its enduring legacy of social insight and conscience mixed with drama has given it universal appeal. Features an introduction by Anna Tolstoy in an exciting new Bantam Classics&#39; package.</p><p>When &#34;Fathers and Sons was first published in Russia, in 1862, it was met with a blaze of controversy about where Turgenev stood in relation to his account of generational misunderstanding. Was he criticizing the worldview of the conservative aesthete, Pavel Kirsanov, and the older generation, or that of the radical, cerebral medical student, Evgenii Bazarov, representing the younger one? The critic Dmitrii Pisarev wrote at the time that the novel &#34;stirs the mind . . . because everything is permeated with the most complete and most touching sincerity.&#34; N. N. Strakhov, a close friend of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, praised its &#34;profound vitality.&#34; It is this profound vitality in Turgenev&#39;s characters that carry his novel of ideas to its rightful place as a work of art and as one of the classics of Russian Literature.<b>Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev</b> was born in 1818 in the Province of Orel, and suffered during his childhood from a tyrannical mother. After the family had moved to Moscow in 1827 he entered Petersburg University where he studied philosophy. When he was nineteen he published his first poems and, convinced that Europe contained the source of real knowledge, went to the University of Berlin. After two years he returned to Russia and took his degree at the University of Moscow. In 1843 he fell in love with Pauline Garcia-Viardot, a young Spanish singer, who influenced the rest of his life; he followed her on her singing tours in Europe and spent long periods in the French house of herself and her husband, both of whom accepted him as a family friend. He sent his daughter by a sempstress to be brought up among the Viardot children. After 1856 he lived mostly abroad, and he became the first Russian writer to gain a wide reputation in Europe; he was a well-known figure in Parisian literary circles, where his friends included Flaubert and the Goncourt brothers, and an honorary degree was conferred on him at Oxford. His series of six novels reflect a period of Russian life from 1830s to the 1870s: they are <b>Rudin</b> (1855), <b>A House of Gentlefolk</b> (1858), <b>On the Eve</b> (1859; a Penguin Classic), <b>Fathers and Sons</b> (1861), <b>Smoke</b> (1867) and <b>Virgin Soil</b> (1876). He also wrote plays, which include the comedy <b>A Month in the Country</b>; short stories and <b>Sketches from a Hunter&#x2019;s Album</b> (a Penguin Classic); and literary essays and memoirs. He died in Paris in 1883 after being ill for a year, and was buried in Russia.</p><h2>I Think, Therefore I Am: All the Philosophy You Need to Know (8) (I Used to Know That ...)</h2><p>Philosophers certainly like to make life sound awfully complicated, whether they're wondering if a falling tree still makes a sound if there's nobody around to hear it (Berkeley) or declaring that everything in the universe is in a state of flux (Heraclitus).

For people all over the world, Anne Frank, the vivacious, intelligent Jewish girl with a crooked smile and huge dark eyes, has become the "human face of the Holocaust." Her diary of twenty-five months in hiding, a precious record of her struggle to keep hope alive through the darkest days of this century, has touched the hearts of millions. Here, after five decades, is the first biography of this remarkable figure. Drawing on exclusive interviews with family and friends, on previously unavailable correspondence, and on documents long kept secret, Melissa Muller creates a nuanced portrait of her famous subject. This is the flesh-and-blood Anne Frank, unsentimentalized and so all the more affecting--Anne Frank restored to history. Muller traces Frank's life from an idyllic childhood in an assimilated family well established in Frankfurt banking circles to her passionate adolescence in German-occupied Amsterdam and her desperate in Bergen Belsen at the age of sixteen. Full of revelations, this richly textured biography casts new light on Anne's relations with her mother, whom she treats harshly in the diary, and solves an enduring mystery: who betrayed the families hiding in the annex just when liberation was at hand? This is an indispensable volume for all those who seek a deeper, richer understanding of Anne Frank and the brutal times in which she lived and died.<br></p><p>One of this book's great strengths is writer Melissa Mï¿½ller's ability to situate Anne Frank's famous diary within a larger historical and biographical context--more than half of it covers the years before the Franks went into hiding. Equally important is her discovery of the existence of five pages Otto Frank removed from his daughter's original diary and entrusted shortly before his death to Cor Sujik, international director of New York's Anne Frank Center. Sujik showed these pages to Mï¿½ller, who accurately notes in the biography that they "enhance our understanding of the diary's author." <p> Until now, readers have known the eight people sequestered in the secret annex through Anne's eyes only. Mï¿½ller reveals everyone's correct names (they were changed for the diary's publication) and tactfully corrects a teenager's skewed perceptions when necessary, always reminding us of the claustrophobic closeness and material deprivation that sometimes fueled Anne's uncharitable comments about, for example, the middle-aged dentist with whom she was forced to share a room. Mï¿½ller also plausibly identifies the Dutch informant who betrayed the secret annex's inhabitants to the Gestapo. Horror suffuses Mï¿½ller's grim recap of the Franks' ordeal at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, though there is some comfort in survivors' reports that Anne, her mother, and her older sister formed "an inseparable trio," all former quarrels forgotten in their fierce struggle to save each other. They failed, and Mï¿½ller does not gloss over that tragedy. But she reminds us that, "In the end, the Nazi terror could not silence Anne's voice, which still rings out for all of us."</p>Melissa Muller is a journalist who has written extensively on childhood.

Set either in remote and lovely surroundings or in bustling areas of pilgrimage, they remain monuments to the intense spiritual experiences of medieval times. In this exploration of the age of monasticism, Christopher Brooke examines the ideals, the achievements and the impact on society of this extraordinary flowering of spirituality.</p><p>Christopher Brooke is a leading scholar of medieval history and is the former professor of Ecclesiastical History at the University of Cambridge . He is also a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, the British Academy and the Medieval Academy of America.</p><h2>The Pushcart War</h2><p>The pushcarts have declared war! New York City&#39;s streets are clogged with huge, rude trucks that park where they want, hold up traffic, and bulldoze into anything that is in their way, and the pushcart peddlers are determined to get rid of them. But the trucks are just as determined to get rid of the pushcarts, and chaos results in the city. The pushcarts have come up with a brilliant strategy that will surely let the hot air out of their enemies. The secret weapon--a peashooter armed with a pin; the target--the vulnerable truck tires. Once the source of the flat tires is discovered, the children of the city joyfully join in with their own pin peashooters. The pushcarts have won one battle, but can they win the war against a corrupt mayor who taxes the pins and prohibits the sale of dried peas?</p><p></p><h2>A Christian on the Mount</h2><p>Puritan writer Thomas Watson invites all believers to explore the much passed-over and neglected hidden gem and discipline of biblical meditation. With godly wisdom and poetic passion, Watson helps us understand what biblical meditation is and why it is essential for Christians to learn it well. He guides us very practically through the mechanics of meditation and outlines fifteen topics with Scripture references to start us off well on our journey. In this rare treasure of a book, Watson is passionate about inviting us to partake with him of the sweet discipline and illuminating adventure of meditating upon God Himself and His Word. This classic book is a must read for any Christian longing for a deeper and more vibrant relationship with Christ and a fresh encounter with Scripture.</p><p>Thomas Watson (1620 -1686) was an English nonconformist Puritan preacher and author. He was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he was noted for remarkably intense study. In 1646 he commenced a sixteen-year pastorate at St. Stephen&#39;s, Walbrook. He showed strong Presbyterian views during the civil war, with, however, an attachment to the king, and in 1651 he was imprisoned briefly with some other ministers for his share in Christopher Love&#39;s plot to recall Charles II of England. He was released on 30 June 1652, and was formally reinstated as vicar of St. Stephen&#39;s Walbrook. He obtained great fame and popularity as a preacher until the Restoration, when he was ejected for Nonconformity. Notwithstanding the rigor of the acts against dissenters, Watson continued to exercise his ministry privately as he found opportunity. Upon the Declaration of Indulgence in 1672 he obtained a license to preach at the great hall in Crosby House. After preaching there for several years, his health gave way, and he retired to Barnston, Essex, where he died suddenly while praying in secret. He was buried on 28 July 1686.</p><h2>Pass in Review: An Illustrated History of West Point Cadets: 1794-Present (General Military)</h2><p>Established in 1802, the United States Military Academy at West Point is the oldest of the United States's service academies. Since the nearly 210 years of its existence, literally thousands of cadets have graced its halls. West Point has long been a leader in establishing traditions that have crept not only into the other service academies, but into colleges and universities throughout the United States. Traditions such as class rings, parades, rank structures, and its own lexicon have made USMA a model to emulate--and these are traditions that cadets must learn on the double. The life of a cadet is highly structured and full of pageantry. Pass in Review will be the first book to examine the lives of the cadets who earn their bars at West Point.<br><br>Author Clyde Cocke and photographer Eilene Harkless Moore will collaborate to chronicle the uniforms, events, and traditions of cadet life at West Point. From dining in the Cadet Mess to strolling the Flirtation Walk to participating in Ring Weekend, readers will get an inside peek into the life of a cadet. West Point's Highlanders, the Pipes and Drums of the United States Corps of Cadets, will be featured, as will the unique West Point Tartan. Contemporary images will blend with seldom-seen artwork from the West Point Museum collection to provide a behind-the-scenes look into the life of USMA cadets.</p><p>Clyde Cocke is a West Point graduate (United States Military Academy, 1977) and former U.S. Army Officer (1977-95) whose positions included Chief, Training Section, First U.S. Army, Fort Meade, Maryland; Small Group Instructor and Course Developer, U.S. Army Armor School, Fort Knox, Kentucky; and Scenario Writer for the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Polk, Louisiana. He also has served as assistant professor of military science for the Army Reserve Officer Training Program at the University of Cincinnati. His work has appeared in Toy Soldier and Model Figure. This will be his first book.&#x201c;Clyde Cocke&#x2019;s <i>Pass in Review</i> is a deftly written and richly illustrated account of the United States Corps of Cadets. Drawing on impressive archival research and his personal experience as a cadet, Cocke gives his readers an insider&#x2019;s look at West Point and, in particular, the lives of the young men and (since 1976) women who make up the Long Gray Line.

Royalties from American Indian Places will be donated to the National Museum of the American Indian. W. Richard West, Jr., the museum&#x2019;s founding director, served as the primary adviser for the book.American Indian Places presents 366 places that are significant to American Indians. Each place is open to the public and provides information about that significance. The book does not include places that became significant after 1900. Because so many voices speak through the book, it is more than place-based history. The Native voices share their emotional and cultural responses to the places and provide insights into what they mean to Native people. Many of the Native authors also tell about their people today. The non-Native voices provide archaeological and historical information about the cultures that these places embody. Thanks to all of these voices, American Indian Places has become a way to learn about Indian peoples and cultures from a perspective grounded in the places they revere.<p></p>The places are organized in five geographic sections, determined by the homelands and subsequent movements of the peoples for whom the places are significant. Within each section, the places are presented in rough chronological order according to the period of their most intense significance. If the significance of a place is not limited to a specific time, the place is presented after one that is nearby geographically. The places are numbered continuously throughout the book, and each place is followed by the abbreviation of the state name, to facilitate locating them on the section maps.<p></p>People who know and revere the places wrote essays on 229 of them. I wrote the short entries for 137 of the places, with the generous assistance of people who know them well (any errors are my own). As place-based history, this book cannot, by its very nature, tell about American Indians as comprehensively as books such as the Encyclopedia of North American Indians or The People: A History of Native America. So the book begins with three essays that provide an overview of the history of American Indians prior to 1900. Additional essays throughout the text provide general information about Native peoples <p></p> <p></p>1. Flint Ridge, OH<br>Off I-70 on Rte. 668, north of Brownsville Museum<p></p>About 10,000 years ago people began quarrying flint in a five-square-mile area here. They shaped the flint into knives, projectile points, and other tools, which were traded so widely that they have been found from the Atlantic coast to western Missouri.<p></p>2. Isle Royale National Park, MI:<br>The Minong Mine<br><i>Caven Clark and Tim Cochrane </i>By ferry from Houghton and Copper Harbor, MI, and from Grand Portage, MN<p></p>People began mining copper at Isle Royale National Park possibly as early as 4500 B.C. The copper is in the Keweenawan geologic formation and is also a component of the glacial drift concentrated by water action along the shorelines and in riverbeds to the south of the formation. Much of the mining was along the Minong Ridge, which the early people and more recently the Ojibwe reached by canoeing into McCargoe Cove. They left hundreds of pit and fissure mines as well as the cobble hammerstones used to separate the nearly pure copper from the basalt bedrock. They used cold-hammering techniques to make spear points, gaffs, hooks, awls, and other tools. More recent people made smaller objects, including knives and beads. They traded or exchanged copper as far as the Ohio Valley and Illinois, where it was fabricated into highly ornamented objects. The Ojibwe revered copper and associated it with the underwater being Mishebeshu, the Long-Tailed Underwater Panther, to which offerings were made for safe canoe passages across the lakes. The Ojibwe also used copper tablets to record clan genealogies.<p></p>Rumors and legends of an island made of copper in Lake Superior attracted French, English, and, later, American explorers, but the Indians kept secret the locations of large boulders of pure copper. After they lost control of the copper sites, Ojibwe worked as miners and fishermen on Isle Royale.Minong (the beautiful place in Ojibwe) continues to be important to Grand Portage and Canadian Ojibwe living along the north shore of Lake Superior.<p></p>Further reading: "A Risky Business: Late Woodland Copper Mining on Lake Superior," by Caven P.

Lepper<br>The fertile valleys of the Ohio River and its many tributaries were home to people known for their prodigious and intricate earthen mounds and enclosures. A cascade of their innovations began to appear in the Ohio Valley by about 800 B.C., when hunting and gathering peoples began to settle in small villages. Their more sedentary way of life was supported by the earliest domesticated plants in this region, including squash, sunflower, maygrass, knotweed, and goosefoot. These early farmers made the region&#x2019;s first pottery vessels and used them to store or cook their harvested crops. They also acquired exotic materials such as copper and marine shells to make ornaments and ritual objects. One of the most distinctive of these early farming cultures was the Adena, named by archaeologists after the estate of former Ohio governor Thomas Worthington, the location of a renowned burial mound. In the early 1900s archaeologists excavated the mound before it was leveled for cultivation. The most spectacular artifact found in the Adena mound was a marvelous cylindrical pipe sculpted in the form of a man, perhaps a shaman, wearing a decorated loincloth and a feather bustle. (It is now in the Ohio Historical Center.) The Adena culture was centered in southern Ohio, southern Indiana, northern Kentucky, and West Virginia from about 800 B.C. to A.D. 100. The people lived in small, dispersed villages, and the mounds may have been ceremonial hubs connecting networks of neighboring people. Two of the most impressive burial mounds are the Grave Creek and Miamisburg mounds, whereas the Story and Shrum mounds are perhaps more typical in size. Mounds State Park is one of the bestpreserved Adena earthwork centers. (The Adena mounds are places numbered 4 through 11.)<p></p>4.

How will the "Katrina failure" impact the next presidential election? And just what should we expect--and not expect--from the government in times of crisis?</p><p>"Big government didn't work," says veteran journalist and political analyst Marvin Olasky. "And it is clear that a new paradigm for responding to national crisis has emerged. Private and faith-based organizations have stepped in and politics will never be the same."</p></p><p><p><strong>Marvin Olasky</strong>, the father of "compassionate conservatism," is a professor of journalism at the University of Texas (Austin) and the editor-in-chief of World, the national weekly news magazine from a biblical perspective. He has written 20 books of history and cultural analysis, including <em>Compassionate Conservatism</em>, <em>The American Leadership Tradition</em>, <em>The Religions Next Door</em>, and <em>The Tragedy of American Compassion</em>. </p><p><strong>I N T R O D U C T I O N</strong></p> <p> We act as if we're immune.We build below sea level, or on barrier islands, or on hillsides with brush that annually burns, or over earthquake faults-and we're shocked, shocked when disasters occur.We use levee repair funds to build parkways or spruce up gambling casinos, and we're shocked when old levees give way.</p> <p> We think that if we have well-built houses we're immune. British colonials had grand homes in Calcutta, but their roofs came off and many of their walls fell in when a cyclone struck the port on October 5, 1864. The cyclone also blew away rickety native huts as if they were twigs: eighty thousand died from the wind and the forty-foot-high wall of water it created.</p> <p> We think that if we build big, strong buildings we're immune. In the 1988 Armenian earthquake, the 1995 Japanese earthquake, and the 1999 Turkish earthquake, new multistoried buildings-including ones that conformed to California's Uniform Building Code-collapsed. Japan's calamity left fiftyfive hundred dead and was, according to a subsequent risk management report, "a terribly striking example of what earthquakes can do to a modern industrialized society."</p> <p> We think that with enough warning we're immune. However, San Franciscans knew that an earthquake was coming, and New Orleans residents knew that a hurricane was coming. Many people over the years have had volcanoes as neighbors. Mount Krakatoa in Indonesia began erupting in May 1883, three months before its enormous explosion killed thirty-six thousand, but undisturbed residents even climbed to the volcano's peak to peer inside. Six years later in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, residents had a running joke that "the dam has burst; take to the hills."When it did break, there was little time to run, so twenty-five hundred died.</p> <p> Some people in New Orleans who thought, or hoped, that the city was immune behind its levees should have read about the city's 1927 flood or about how the Yangtze River flood in 1954 killed forty thousand and left one million people homeless. The United States had planned to build the world's largest dam on the Yangtze River, for both power and flood control, but China's new Communist government used clay soil to build levees that collapsed, submerging an area twice the size of Texas.</p> <p> Disasters happen, but the number of fatalities increases when short-term goals take precedence over long-term safety. Before Mount Pelee erupted on the French island of Martinique in the West Indies on May 8, 1902, residents of the nearby city of St. Pierre smelled sulfur fumes for weeks. Compared to Martinique officials, Louisiana's recent leaders seem like geniuses. The governor in St. Pierre did not want anything to get in the way of his May 10 reelection, so he set up roadblocks to keep constituents from leaving before they could cast ballots. The local newspaper mocked those who worried. Its editor, along with forty thousand other residents, died during the eruption.</p> <p> Building houses below sea level or along a hurricane-hit shore makes as much sense as the southern European practice, during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, of using church vaults to store gunpowder. Churches had steeples or bell towers susceptible to lightning strikes: a lightning strike, fire, and subsequent gunpowder explosion in Brescia, Italy, in 1769 killed three thousand people. A similar lightning strike and explosion on the island of Rhodes in 1856 killed four thousand.</p> <p> Unanticipated problems are inevitable, but politics and pride can turn them into disasters. In 1912 some fifteen hundred died when the "unsinkable" Titanic sunk on its first transatlantic voyage, in part because of a prideful lack of concern about icebergs and in part because of a technical flaw: the separating walls in its "watertight" compartments did not extend all the way to the top, so the water flowed from one to the next. Two years later, one thousand voyagers died on the St. Lawrence River when the Empress of Ireland, going too fast amid fog, slammed into a coaling ship. These were not acts of God. They were acts of men.</p> <p> Why do such disasters happen? Thousands of books and articles have tackled the subject of theodicy, asking whether catastrophes disprove the belief that God exists and that He is good: at the end of 2005, Google showed 275,000 mentions of "theodicy." "Anthropodicy," the question of whether man acts rightly (and whether "human intelligence" is an oxymoron), garnered only 145 mentions. Our tendency to put God rather than ourselves on trial is evident.</p> <p> In 1946 the Winecoff Hotel in Atlanta, after running ads announcing it was "Absolutely Fire Proof," caught fire and 119 died. Twelve-inch-thick brick walls made the structure fireproof, but everything inside burned. The fifteen-story hotel had no fire alarm or sprinkler system, no fire escapes or fire doors, just one spiral staircase plus elevators. An act of man, surely.</p> <p> Hurricanes, earthquakes, and the like are acts of God. The extent of the damage they cause often depends on the politics and economics of man. That goes for good news as well as bad.When Hurricane Fifi wreaked havoc in Honduras in 1974, widespread starvation ensued. Yet when Hurricane Katrina destroyed homes, a robust American economy kept famine from being a fear. Still, we are not immune to natural catastrophe, terroristcaused disaster, and the unnatural amplification of both.</p> <p> In one sense, personal disasters surround us. Every ten seconds in the United States a person is injured in a motor vehicle accident. Every twenty-six seconds a person has a heart attack. Every fifty-seven seconds a person dies from cancer. But this book examines incidents, some partially preventable, that have a major negative impact on the ability of an entire community to live peaceably. Some disasters, like hurricanes or earthquakes, are suddenly explosive. Others, like pandemics or the plagues of terrorism or revolutionary bloodletting, may start slowly and conclude with prolonged whimpering.</p> <p> This book examines the politics of disaster in six parts, each with three chapters. Using the Hurricane Katrina disaster as a case study, part 1 details what went wrong with government and media responses to Hurricane Katrina and explains how those problems were part of a long trend in disaster responses. Part 2 describes what went right by assessing the work of three Katrina responders that were effective: business, the military, and religious groups.</p> <p> Part 3 proposes a reconceptualization of how we respond to disaster and suggests specific public policy measures based on our experience. Part 4 looks in detail at the role of faith-based organizations in disaster response. Part 5 examines several recent disasters abroad and the effectiveness of key responders in meeting the challenges. Part 6 examines three disasters that many believe are likely to occur in the United States sometime during the coming decades-a California earthquake, nuclear terrorism, and a pandemic-and assesses how prepared we are to respond.</p> <p> We'll be investigating some new and frightening developments, but it's important to remember that disasters aren't new. Brimstone buried Sodom and Gomorrah about four thousand years ago, and an earthquake about three hundred years later brought the Minoan civilization on Crete to an end. Greek philosophers such as Plato knew about disaster: an earthquake and tidal wave buried the Greek city of Helike in 373 BC. In AD 79 medieval disasters destroyed cities such as Dunwich, England, and Rungholt, Germany. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake became a propagandistic windfall for Voltaire.</p> <p> Nor is the way we respond entirely new. The National Academy of Public Administration, in 1993, expressed concern about the "CNN Syndrome": "Disaster and emergencies provide dramatic news and the appetites of news media, particularly television, are insatiable. . . . [Disasters] will now be 'nationalized' and politicized as a result of media coverage. . . . The media pressure reluctant local and state leaders to 'ask for federal help,' presidents to dispatch such help, and representatives and senators to demand it on behalf of their constituents." That's all true, but when Mount Vesuvius exploded in AD 79 and covered Pompeii and Herculaneum with molten ash, messengers reported the horror, Romans clamored for relief to be sent, and Emperor Titus complied.</p> <p> Media move much more quickly now and make news of suffering immediate, but most Americans still don't take the precaution of always having several days of food and water on hand. Rebecca O'Connor, in December 2005, wrote in the Los Angeles Times: "[I] took a good look in my pantry yesterday. I have enough soup and refried beans to last two days. There's a six-pack of water and a half a box of crackers, both of which would be gone by tomorrow if something happened today. I have no spare batteries, which isn't a problem because I don't own a battery-operated radio. . . . I live right smack between two active fault lines. A devastating earthquake is inevitable here in somebody's lifetime. Still, I just can't bring myself to stock my shelves. . . . I surely believe in natural disasters. I just don't believe they'll happen to me."</p> <p> While we act as if we are immune from disaster, governmental policies now normalize it. Just as insurance now covers regular dental checkups, disaster designation now covers thoroughly predictable events such as blizzards. The first president with the power to issue a declaration of disaster, Dwight Eisenhower, issued 107 such declarations during his eight years in office, an average of thirteen per year. That rose to an annual average of eighteen during the Kennedy/Johnson years and more than ...</p></p><h2>Church Mice in Action</h2><p>Another favourite Church Mouse story available for a whole new audience to enjoy.

For a long time, they have kept quiet, occupying the lower levels of the Castle. But now they are going to be heard... Tal and Milla are no longer alone in their quest for the truth about their world. They have been joined by Crow, a rebel Underfolk, and his band of conspirators. They know many secrets about the Castle--and are on the verge of uncovering the greatest secret of all. The darkness is growing deeper. The shadows are growing stronger. And Tal and Milla are in greater danger than ever before.</p><p>Garth Nix is the New York Times best-selling author of the Seventh Tower series, as well as the acclaimed novels SABRIEL, LIRAEL, and ABHORSEN. He lives in Sydney, Australia, with his wife and children.Gr 5-7-Nix picks his adventure up in midstride, sending renegade aristocrat Tal from the lowest depths of the immense, sunless Castle in which he has spent most of his young life to one of its highest peaks, and dispatching Tal's warrior companion, Milla, back to her ice-dwelling people with a warning that the Veil protecting the world from the deadly shadowrealm Aenir is weakening. As the author has created a very complex world in previous volumes, and the plot has gone too far to recapitulate easily, readers new to the series will flounder; still, the pace seldom lets up. Tal's affable but dim-witted "Spiritshadow" Adras makes a comic foil worthy of a Disney movie, and-sure sign of a Nix tale-the various uglies, from Waspwyrms and Dretch to archfiend Shadowmaster Sushin, are thoroughly bone-chilling. After plenty of narrow squeaks, exciting chase scenes, and stunning revelations (but no resolutions), fans will be eager for episode five: and voil...!

Was she the people's princess, who electrified the world with her beauty &amp; humanitarian missions? Or was she a manipulative, media-savvy neurotic who nearly brought down the monarchy? The author knew Diana personally, understood her world, its players, and has far-reaching insights into the royals, and the Queen herself. In the Diana Chronicles, you will meet a formidable female cast and get to know the society they inhabit...as you never have before. You will read about Diana's sexually-charged mother, her subtly scheming grandmother, the stepmother she hated, but eventually came to understand, and a terrifying trio of in-laws and relations: Fergie, the force of nature whose life was full of its own unacknowledged pathos, Princess Margaret, the fading glamour girl. the implacable Queen Mother and more formidible than all of them, her mother-in-law, the Queen, whose admiration Diana sought until the day she died. Add Camilla Parker-Bowles, the ultimate " other woman" into this combustible mix, and its no wonder Diana felt the need to break out of her royal cage into celebrity culture, where she found her own power and used it to devasting effect; Trade Paperback, 481pp with Index.</p><p>Tina Brown was 25 when she became editor-in-chief of England's oldest glossy,<i> The Tatler</i>, reviving the nearly defunct 270 year old magazine with an attitude and style that gave it a 300 percent circulation rise. She went on to become editor-in-chief of <i>Vanity Fair</i>, and won four National Magazine Awards. In 1992 she became the first female editor of <i>The New Yorker</i> where she raised newsstand circulation by 145<br>percent. In 2000, Ms. Brown was awarded C.B.E. (Commander of the British Empire) from Queen Elizabeth. She is married to Sir Harold Evans. The couple have two children and reside in New York.<b>Chapter Twenty<br>The Last Picture Show</b><br><br><i><br>Is she an angel?<br></i>&#x2014;Helena Ussova, aged seven, land-mine victim in Angola, January 1997<br>Diana never looked better than in the days after her divorce. Divestment was the name of the game, in her life and in her looks. The downsizing started with her Kensington Palace staff, which she reduced to cleaner, cook, and dresser. The assiduous Paul Burrell became maï¿½tre d&#x2019; of her private life, combining the roles of P.A., man Friday, driver, delivery boy, confidant, and crying towel. &#x201c;He used to pad around listening to all,&#x201d; says a friend of Diana&#x2019;s mother. &#x201c;I was quite sure his ear was pressed firmly to the key hole when I went to Kensington Palace for lunch.&#x201d; <br><br>Diana reinforced her break with married life by stuffing a heavy-duty garbage bag with her entire set of Prince of Wales china and then smashing it with a hammer. &#x201c;Make a list of everything we need,&#x201d; she told Burrell. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s spend a bit more of <i>his</i> money while we can.&#x201d; <br><br>Diana now used police protection only when she attended a public event. Her favorite officer was Colin Tebbutt, who had retired from the Royal Squad. He was a tall, fair-haired matinee idol who was also a Class One driver, trained by the SAS. Tebbutt knew that by going to work for Diana he was effectively shutting the door to any future work with the Prince of Wales, but he had a soft spot for Diana. &#x201c;There was always a buzz when she was at home. I thought she was beginning to enjoy life. She was a different lady, maturing.&#x201d; Tebbutt says she would always sit in the front of the car, unlike the other Royals, such as Princess Margaret, who called him by his surname and, without looking up from her newspaper, barked, &#x201c;Wireless!&#x201d; when she wanted Tebbutt to turn on the radio. <br><br>&#x201c;I drive looking in all three mirrors, so I&#x2019;d say to Diana &#x2018;I&#x2019;m not looking at your legs, Ma&#x2019;am&#x2019; and she&#x2019;d laugh.&#x201d; The press knew the faces of Diana&#x2019;s drivers, so to shake them off Tebbutt sometimes wore disguises. &#x201c;She wanted to go to the hairdresser one day, shortly before she died. I had an old Toyota MRT which she called the &#x2018;tart trap,&#x2019; so I drove her in that. I went to the trunk and got out a big baseball hat and glasses. When she came out I was dripping with sweat, and she said &#x2018;What on earth are you doing?&#x2019; I said, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m in disguise.&#x2019; She said, &#x2018;It may have slipped your notice, but <i>I&#x2019;m</i> the Princess of Wales.&#x2019; &#x201d; <br><br>Every Tuesday night, the Princess sat at her desk in her study at Kensington Palace, writing her steady stream of heartfelt thank-you letters and listening to a piano playing Rachmaninoff&#x2019;s Piano Concerto No. 2 and&#x2014;her favorite&#x2014;Manning Sherwin&#x2019;s &#x201c;A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square.&#x201d; In the living room, Maureen Stevens, a clerk from the Prince of Wales&#x2019;s office, who also happened to be a talented concert pianist, gave Diana a weekly private recital as she worked. You can almost hear Stevens&#x2019;s piano rippling in the background as Diana writes a fulsome note to her close friend, <i>Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar</i> editor Liz Tilberis: &#x201c;Dearest Liz, How proud I was to be at your side on Monday evening... so deeply moved by your personal touch&#x2014;the presents for the boys, candles at the hotel and flowers to name but few but most of all your beaming smile, your loving heart. I am always here for you, Liz.&#x201d; Sometimes Diana would stop and telephone the <i>Daily Mail&#x2019;s</i> Richard Kay&#x2014;&#x201c;Ricardo,&#x201d; she called him&#x2014;to help her with the phraseology of a letter. KP was her fortress. On warm summer afternoons, she vanished into its walled garden in shorts and T&#x2013;shirt and her Versace sunglasses, carrying a bag of books and CDs for her Walkman. On weekends, when William and Harry were home, Burrell would see her in a flowing cotton skirt on her bicycle with the basket in front, speeding down the Palace drive with the boys pedaling furiously behind her. On her thirty&#x2013;sixth birthday, in July, she received ninety bouquets of flowers and Harry gathered a group of classmates to sing &#x201c;Happy Birthday&#x201d; to her over the telephone. <br><br>Diana&#x2019;s charity commitments were pared down from around a hundred to the six she most cared about: Centrepoint, the Royal Marsden Hospital, the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, the English National Ballet, the Leprosy Mission, and the National AIDS Trust. The public announcement she insisted on reaped her unnecessary flak and the resignation of her media adviser, Jane Atkinson. But Diana had a reason for being explicit. She wanted to avoid situations where she was just a letterhead. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;m going to talk on behalf of any cause, I want to go and see the problem for myself and learn about it,&#x201d; she told the chairman of the Washington Post Company, Katharine Graham, at that time. <br><br>There was a round of social purging. Lord and Lady Palumbo were excised after Peter&#x2019;s candid warnings about Martin Bashir. Elton John was in the deep freeze after acting as a go-between with Diana and Gianni Versace for the fashion designer&#x2019;s coffee&#x2013;table book <i>Rock and Royalty</i>. (The pictures of the Princess and the boys appeared amid a portfolio of seminude male models, and Diana feared it would further annoy the Queen.) Sir Ronald Grierson was bounced after he made the mistake of offering a job to one of the many secretaries Diana froze out. And Fergie was back in Siberia, this time for good. The divorced Duchess had cashed in with an anodyne memoir, which was full of nice comments about her sister&#x2013;in&#x2013;law&#x2014; except for one fatal line. She wrote that when she borrowed a pair of Diana&#x2019;s shoes she had caught a verrucca&#x2014;plantar&#x2019;s wart&#x2014;from them. Goddesses don&#x2019;t get warts. Despite Fergie&#x2019;s pleading apologies, Diana never spoke to her again. In 1997, the Princess gave a birthday party for her friend David Tang and told him he could ask anyone he wanted. <br><br>&#x201c;Anyone?&#x201d; he asked. <br><br>&#x201c;Anyone.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;All right, then&#x2014;Fergie.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely not,&#x201d; Diana replied, and would not be moved. <br><br>A new and unexpected ally was Raine. In 1993, Diana had finally made her peace with her formidable stepmother. The painful years of separation and divorce from Charles made the Princess see her old adversary in a different light. Still grieving for Daddy, her greatest support, Diana was at last able to recognize that Raine had loved him, too. She invited her stepmother for a weepy reconciliation over lunch at Kensington Palace. For moral support, Raine brought along her fiancï¿½, the French Count Jean Franï¿½ois de Chambrun. The precaution turned out to be unnecessary. Afterward, the Princess and the Countess were often sighted deep in a tï¿½te&#x2013;ï¿½&#x2013;tï¿½te at the Connaught Grill. One of Raine&#x2019;s cautions was to try to stay on friendly terms with Charles for the sake of the children. She told Diana that both she&#x2014;Raine&#x2014;and her mother, Barbara Cartland, had maintained warm relations with all their former husbands and lovers. <br><br>Diana also made an improbable friend of Katharine &#x201c;Kay&#x201d; Graham. They had met in the summer of 1994, when Lucia Flecha de Lima had brought Diana to Kay&#x2019;s beachfront house on Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard. Not long after that, Kay gave a luncheon for Diana and Hillary Clinton at her Washington home. At a British Embassy lunch on the same visit, Diana met Colin Powell again. He told her he had been nominated to lead her in the dancing at the gala that night to raise money for the Nina Hyde Breast Cancer Foundation. Scotland Yard had been worried that at a ball in Chicago earlier in the year a stranger had cut in on Diana&#x2019;s dancing partner. The General was deemed able to handle such an eventuality, but the Princess suggested she do a few practice spins with him in the Embassy drawing room. &#x201c;She was easy with any melody, and we did all right in our rehearsal,&#x201d; says Powell. &#x201c;She told me, &#x2018;there&#x2019;s only one thing you ought to know. I&#x2019;ll be wearing a backless dress tonight. Can you cope with that?&#x2019; &#x201d; Flirting with the big boys&#x2014;what bliss! <br><br>Diana thrived in America. &#x201c;There is no &#x2018;Establishment&#x2019; there,&#x201d; she told her fashion friend Roberto Devorik&#x2014;wrongly, of course, but correct in the sense that America had no Establishment whose rules or members could possibly hurt her feelings. Richard Kay says she thought of America as &#x201c;a country so brimming over with glittery people and celebrities that she would be able to disappear.&#x201d; <br><br>Like her life, Diana&#x2019;s taste in fashion became pared down and emphatic after her divorce. &#x201c;English style refracted through an un&#x2013;English sensibility&#x201d; was how <i>Vogue&#x2019;s</i> Hamish Bowles defined it. Her new evening dresses were minimalist and sexy, a look that had been taboo when she was an in-house Royal. &#x201c;She knew she had great legs and she wanted to show them off,&#x201d; said the designer Jacques Azagury. She wore his stunning red bugle&#x2013;bead tunic over a short pencil skirt in Venice in 1995 and his blue crystal&#x2013;beaded cocktail dress six inches above the knee to another Serpentine gallery evening. Diana actually looked her best at her most informal. Jumping rangily out of her car for lunch with Rosa Monckton at the Caprice, wearing stone&#x2013;washed jeans, a white T-shirt, a beautifully cut navy blue blazer, and bare feet in flats (she was usually shod in Jimmy Choo&#x2019;s black grosgrain &#x201c;Diana&#x201d; loafers), she was spectacular. <i>Vanity Fair</i> assigned the Peruvian-born photographer Mario Testino to capture h...</p><h2>Wisdom from the Ninja Village of the Cold Moon</h2><p>Poems explore the traditional philosophical principles and teachings of the practitioners of the Japanese martial art, ninjutsu</p><p></p><h2>Mama Outside, Mama Inside</h2><p><br>The perfect book for Mother's Day!<br> <br>A mother has lots of preparation to do when expecting a baby--whether she's a bird weaving a nest in the tree outside, or a woman setting up a nursery inside her home.

She lives in Huntington, New York, with her family.<br>PreS-K. Soft, glowing acrylic art and gentle, simple prose establish parallels between two mothers-to-be--a bird (Mama Outside) and a human (Mama Inside)--both of whom are preparing for new babies. With art that juxtaposes the characters on facing pages or incorporates them into spreads with external or internal window views, the story portrays similarities--as Mama Outside feathers her nest, Mama Inside furnishes the baby's room. There are also differences; the bird's babies "peck-peck-peck until their shells crick-crick-cr-<i>a-ack</i>!" while that same morning, Mama Inside's baby "slips into the world." At book's end, the mamas share a moment of eye contact, then mama bird and babies take to the sky, and the human mother rocks her child to sleep. The parallels and the illustrations warmly convey motherly love and care (with some daddy participation) in both the human and the animal world. <i>Shelle Rosenfeld</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Washagon College's English department, in thrall to Glanda Gazza, a chair who dreams of seceding, together with a department of literary theory that can dispense with literature altogether, plans to ease out do-nothing Prof. Adam Snell at its May meeting. But the proceedings are disrupted when Snell turns up missing from his home--and all copies of his small-press novel, Sovrana Sostrata, have disappeared too, hunted down by a nemesis who turns out to be crazed rising star Frank Underwood, determined to wipe out every trace of Adam's existence. Adam's few friends find him alive in a nearby corner of the campus (his life preserved by the miraculous qualities of the experimental-growth mucca-grass he's landed in), but Underwood is already practicing with a target pistol for the ultimate act of deconstruction. Can Adam's colleague Hal Emmons and his aspiring republisher Harper Nathan keep him alive long enough for him to finish his new novel, On Wonderment, or will he be marginalized by the profusion of satiric riffs and intertextual jests, by anything from a revolt of footnotes to getting swallowed by his own book? Though first-novelist Grudin (The Grace of Great Things, etc.) never quite pulls his shaggy crime plot, his metatextual bromides, and his satire together, they're all consistently sunny and good-humored. The satiric butts are too familiar and broadly ridiculed to make this as trenchant or funny as David Lodge; it's more likely to remind you of the kinder, gentler academic follies of Jane Langton, or of Michael Malone's Foolscap. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This skillful satire, set at the University of Washagon, pits "evil" literary theorists against classical scholars: someone is trying to kill English professor Adam Snell and his novel. Grudin's concern about the lack of support for creativity in an academic setting, previously explored in the nonfiction work Grace of Great Things ( LJ 5/15/90), here gets a fairy-tale resolution, with fame, wealth, and love coming to Snell as a result of his truth-telling novel Sovrana Sostrata. Funny and perceptive, Book parodies literary forms (there's a revolt among the footnotes) and the power struggles within university life. This unique, well-constructed blend of truth, humor, and suspense is essential for academics: fun to read, but with real sustenance.<br><i>- Rebecca S.

The last unpublished works of the late Hugo Pratt.</p><p>Hugo Pratt is an Italian comic artist whose best-known character is the existentialist adventurer, captain Corto Maltese. Pratt&#39;s own extensive travels are the inspiration for Corto Maltese&#39;s adventures. In Pratt&#39;s youth he accompanied his parents on journeys first to Venice, and then to Ethiopia - both of which became settings for his future works. The family returned to Venice in the early 1940&#39;s, where Pratt entered its Academy of Fine Arts. In 1945, he met Mario Faustinelli, with whom he created his first comic book, Asso di Picche. In these early years of Pratt&#39;s career, he became part of what was called &#34;the Venice group.&#34; This association of writers and artists drew inspiration from adventure literature by such writers as Herman Melville, Jack London and Joseph Conrad, who were not seen during Mussolini&#39;s reign. Finding few opportunities for comic artists in postwar Italy, Pratt and Faustinelli moved to Argentina in 1950. There he created some of his most important comics: Sgt. Kirk, Ernie Pike, Anna della Jungla, and Wheeling. In 1967, shortly after Pratt&#39;s move back to Italy he wrote Una Ballata del Mare Salato for the newly founded monthly Sgt. Kirk. This was a brooding South Seas adventure featuring a compelling main character who would later become the famous Corto Maltese.</p><h2>Mapping Spaces: Networks of Knowledge in 17th Century Landscape Painting</h2><p>Seventeenth-century Europe saw a fruitful creative exchange between the arts and contemporaneous scientific thought. <i>Mapping Spaces</i> traces the multifaceted dimensions of this exchange with contributions from more than forty leading scholars who, together, reflect on the influence of science and technology on the arts through the specific study of the process of mapping in Dutch landscape paintings of the mid-seventeenth century.<br><br> The dialogue between the arts and sciences, the contributors find, extends back well beyond the new media and digital satellite imagery of modern times. Many Dutch painters of the period are believed to have employed systems of remote sensing for their paintings. For his well-known historical battle scenes, for instance, Pieter Snayers would have required an understanding of both ballistics and geography.

He is more often quoted than read, his name invoked in party conversation on such diverse topics as marriage, sleep, deceit, mental concentration, and patriotism, to generally humorous effect. But in Johnson&#x2019;s own day, he was best known as an essayist, critic, and lexicographer: a gifted writer possessed of great force of mind and wisdom. Writing a century after Johnson, Ruskin wrote of Johnson&#x2019;s essays: He &#x201c;taught me to measure life, and distrust fortune...he saved me forever from false thoughts and futile speculations.&#x201d; Peter Martin here presents &#x201c;the heart of Johnson,&#x201d; a selection of some of Johnson&#x2019;s best moral and critical essays. At the center of this collection are the periodical essays from the Rambler, Adventurer, and Idler. Also included are Johnson&#x2019;s great moral fable, Rasselas; the Prefaces to the Dictionary and his edition of Shakespeare; and selections from Lives of the Poets. Together, these works&#x2014;allied in their literary, social, and moral concerns&#x2014;are the ones that continue to speak urgently to readers today.</p><p>Peter Martin has taught English literature on both sides of the Atlantic and is the author of A Life of James Boswell.Readers should find much pleasure and insight in this collection. (Anthony Pucci <i>Library Journal</i> 2009-09-01)<br><br>We see in [Johnson's] essays the tiny brushwork of brilliant self-portraiture; we hear the rhythm of moral seriousness, the sound of contemplation as it engages with the questions of how to live and how to manage in the face of death. But most of all we feel the reach of an author--a writer attempting to reach past self-doubt, poverty, cant, and orthodoxy, in order to assert the power of individual authorship and free thinking in the face of more nebulous authorities. Samuel Johnson may have failed often enough to be personable, but he nevertheless freed subjectivity...and brought both dignity and self-sufficiency to the writing game, allowing authors to be who they chose to be, unshackled from patronage and the requirement to please great men. We see it in his essays and we see it again in his <i>Lives of the Poets</i>: a writer's writer, beckoning individual creative power out of the mire of dependency, making the work answerable only to high standards of excellence stringently applied. (Andrew O'Hagan <i>New York Review of Books</i> 2009-10-08)<br><br>This handsome book, with its fine printing and striking cover, commemorates the 2009 tercentennial of Johnson's birth by introducing uninitiated readers to the most accessible of his writing, Martin satisfies this aim well, producing a title that serves as a companion to his <i>Samuel Johnson: A Biography</i>. (C. S. Vilmar <i>Choice</i> 2010-02-01)<br><br>Peter Martin, who joined the crowded ranks of Johnson's biographers last year, has given us a fair representation of [his] works here...Harvard Press deserves lavish praise for producing a handsome, well-made edition.

Jules can be found on Twitter, Facebook (Fan Page), and her website julesbennett.com. She holds contests via these three outlets with each release and loves to hear from readers!"You know how to please a man."<br><br>Megan Richards desperately wished those words coming from her best friend's kissable lips had been said in a different context. Alas, Cameron St. John was only referring to the medium-well steak she had grilled, and not a bedroom romp.<br><br>One day she would shock them both when she declared her desire, her need for the man she'd known since kindergarten, when he'd pulled her pigtails and she'd retaliated by taking her safety scissors to his mullet. A mutual respect was instantly born, and they'd been friends since&#x2014;sans pigtails and mullet.<br><br>"I figured you'd been eating enough take-out junk and needed some real food," she told him, watching in admiration as he picked up their dinner plates and started loading her dishwasher.<br><br><i>Oh, yeah.</i> His mama had raised him right, and Megan didn't think there was a sexier sight than a domestic man...especially one with muscles that flexed so beautifully with each movement.<br><br>Since his back was turned, she soaked up the view. The man came by his rippled beauty honestly, with hours dedicated to rigorous workouts. She worked out, too&#x2014;just last night she'd exercised with a box of cookies&#x2014;which would be the main reason his body was so perfectly toned while hers was so perfectly dimpled and shapely.<br><br>Cameron closed the dishwasher door and gave the countertop a swift swipe with the cloth before turning to face her. With his hands resting on either side of his narrow hips, he might have looked all laid-back and casual, but the man positively reeked of alpha sexiness. His impressive height and broad shoulders never failed to send a sucker punch straight to her active hormones.<br><br>Too bad he was married to his job as chief of police in Stonerock, Tennessee. Besides, she was too afraid to lose him as a friend to really open up and let years of emotions come pouring out. Well, that and Cameron and his family had been the only true stability she'd known since her parents were killed in a car accident during a snowstorm when they'd been traveling up north to visit friends. Megan couldn't risk damaging the bond she had with Cam.<br><br>Oh, and he'd made it perfectly clear on more than one occasion that he wouldn't get into a committed relationship. Not as long as he was in law enforcement, thanks to an incident involving his partner when they'd been rookies.<br><br>Yup, he didn't do relationships; just like he didn't do healthy food.<br><br>"I don't eat junk," he defended himself.<br><br>Megan tipped her head, quirking a brow.<br><br>"I'll have you know that Burger-rama is real food, and they know my order without me even repeating it." Cameron crossed his arms over his wide chest and offered her that lady-killer smile.<br><br>Laughing, Megan came to her feet. "I rest my case."<br><br>With a quick glance at his watch, Cameron pushed off the counter and sighed. "I better get going. I need to rest before heading out tonight."<br><br>She had no clue what he was working on; she rarely did. He was pretty adamant about keeping his work absent from their conversations. He'd tell the occasional funny drunken-fight story, but when it came to a serious investigative case, he was pretty tight-lipped.<br><br>Whatever he was working on must be major, seeing as how he'd been heading out to work at midnight several nights a week&#x2014;not something a chief normally did. The new lines between his brows and the dark circles beneath his eyes spoke volumes about his new schedule.<br><br>"You're working yourself to death. You know that, right? Between all the crazy hours and the junk food. You can't be getting enough sleep."<br><br>One corner of his mouth tipped up in a smile. That cocky, charming grin always had the same heartgripping impact. How many women had been mesmerized by that beautiful, sexy smile?<br><br>"I'll be fine," he assured her, pulling her into a friendly hug. "This case should wrap up soon, and I'll be back to somewhat normal hours, complete with sleep. The junk food remains, though."<br><br>Two out of three wasn't too bad. Besides, normal for him meant ten-hour days instead of twelve or fourteen. Reminding him of his father's bypass surgery last year would do no good. The St. John men were a stubborn bunch. She should know; she'd been the family sidekick since grade school.<br><br>Megan kept her mouth shut and wrapped her arms around his waist as she slowly inhaled his familiar scent. Closing her eyes, she wished for so much. She wished Cam would wake up and see how deeply she cared for him, she wished her brother would straighten his life out and she wished she knew what to do about the out-of-town job offer she'd just received.<br><br>None of those things were going to happen right now, so she held on tight and enjoyed the moment of being enveloped by the man she'd loved for years. If friendship was all they were destined for, then she'd treasure what she had and not dwell on the unattainable.<br><br>Cameron eased back, resting his firm hands on her shoulders. "You okay? You seem tense."<br><br><i>Really?</i> Because she'd pretty much melted into his embrace. The cop in him always managed to pick up every little detail around him, yet the man in him was totally oblivious to the vibes she sent out. It would be so much easier if he just magically knew how she felt and took that giant first step so she didn't have to. The passive-aggressive thing was never her style, but in this instance she really wished he'd just read her mind.<br><br>"I'm fine," she assured him, offering a grin. "Just a lot on my mind lately."<br><br>Wasn't that an understatement?<br><br>His dark brows drew together as those signature bright blue St. John eyes studied her. "What can I do to help?"<br><br>Oh, if he only knew. One day.<br><br>"Nothing." She reached up, patted his stubbled jaw and stepped back to avoid further temptation. "Go rest so you can head out and save Stonerock from all the bad guys."<br><br>The muscle in his jaw jumped. "I'm working on it."<br><br>"I hope you're careful," she added, always worried she'd get a phone call from one of his brothers or his parents telling her the worst. Because Cameron would put his life on the line for anybody. He just wouldn't put his heart on the line.<br><br>He laughed. "Yes, Mom, I'm careful."<br><br>Swatting him on his hard pec, Megan narrowed her eyes. "I have to ask. You make me worry."<br><br>"Nothing to worry about," he assured her, with a friendly kiss on her forehead. "I'm good at my job."<br><br>"You're so humble, too."<br><br>With a shrug, he pulled his keys from his pocket. "Eli and Nora's baby is being christened tomorrow. You're still planning on coming, right?"<br><br>"Are you going to make it?"<br><br>Cameron nodded and headed toward the back door. He always came and went via her back door. He never knocked, just used a key when it was locked and made himself at home.<br><br>"I'll make it," he told her, his hand resting on the antique knob. "I may even have time to run home and nap and shower for the occasion."<br><br>"How about I pick you up?" she offered.<br><br>He lived in her neighborhood, and they tended to ride together when they went anywhere. They were pretty much like an old married couple, you know, just without the sex and shared living quarters.<br><br>"Be there at nine." His finger tapped on the doorknob. "Lock up behind me."<br><br>Rolling her eyes, she gave him a mock salute as he left. The worry was definitely a two-way street.<br><br>Now that she was alone with her thoughts, she had to face the unknowns that circled around in her mind. This job offer had come out of nowhere.<br><br>Was it a sign that she needed to move on? She'd been in Stonerock nearly her entire life; she was still single and had nothing holding her back.<br><br>Except Cameron.<br><br>After scrubbing her sink and table, Megan was still no closer to making a decision. She loved being a therapist at the local counseling center; she loved her patients and truly felt as if she was making an impact in their lives.<br><br>The new job would be in Memphis, nearly two hours away. The new facility would offer her a chance at helping more people, even taking charity cases, which would allow her to comfort and guide people she never could've reached otherwise. How could she say no?<br><br>As she sank onto the chair at her kitchen table, she thought of her brother. He was an adult, but he'd never been able to take care of himself. The questionable decisions he made kept snowballing into more bad decisions&#x2014;each one seemingly worse than the last. He always counted on her as a crutch to fall back on. What would happen to him if she left? Would he finally man up and take control of his life? See just how dependent he'd become and actually want to change?<br><br>More to the point: What would happen with Cameron? Before she made the decision, she would have to seriously consider gathering up the courage to tell him the secret she kept in the pit of her soul.<br><br>This job was a catalyst for pushing her in that direction. She needed to move on one way or another, though she'd rather move on with him. Either way, she'd know if years of wanting and dreaming had been for naught.<br><br>She'd wanted a relationship with him since they'd graduated high school, but the timing to reveal her feelings had never been right. Between her parents' deaths, his deployment and Megan always putting her life on hold to help her brother, she just had never found an opening.<br><br>Cameron was the only solid foundation in her life. What happened if she told him how much she loved him and it ruined their friendship? Could she take that risk?<br><br>He'd told her he'd never consider being in a committed relationship. He'd shared the story of the night his partner had died and how he'd had to witness the widow's complete breakdown. Cam had told her he'd never put anyone through that.<br><br>Still, she had to let him know how she felt. She couldn't go through life playing the what-if game forever, and he deserved to know. By not giving him a chance to make a decision, she could be missing out on the best thing that had ever happened to her.<br><br>Megan folded her arms across the table and rested her head on them. She really had no choice...not if she wanted to live her life without regrets.<br><br>Some risks were worth taking. She knew without a doubt if Cameron wanted to take things beyond friendship, the joy would be totally worth the bundle of nerves that had taken up residence in her stomach.<br><br>Cameron had managed about a three-hour nap before the christening. He'd also showered and shaved for the occasion. His mother would be so proud.<br><br>He'd just finished adjusting his navy tie when his front door opened and closed. Heels clicked on the hardwood floor, growing louder as Megan approached the hallway. He assumed the visitor was Megan, unless one of his brothers had opted to don stilettos today.<br><br>He knew of Megan's love for breakneck shoes when she wasn't wearing her cowgirl boots. Didn't matter to him if she was barefoot. Cameron had fought his attraction to Megan for a few years now. At first he'd thought the temptation would go away. No such luck. Being a cop's wife, even in a small town, wasn't something he'd put on anyone he cared about. He couldn't handle knowing he'd put the worry and stress of being a cop's wife on Megan, so he pulled up every bit of his self-control to block his true feelings.<br><br>Unfortunately, Cameron had never wanted to avoid his best friend as much as he did right this moment. Dread filled his stomach as he recalled the things he'd witnessed last night while monitoring the drugstore parking lot. The events that had unfolded on his watch put a whole new spin on this case...and quite possibly his relationship with Megan. No, not quite possibly. Without a doubt the new developments would shatter their perfect bond.<br><br>Her brother had gotten involved with the wrong crowd&#x2014;a crowd Cameron was about to take down.<br><br>She deserved to be happy, deserved to live free from her brother's illegal activities, and Cameron would do anything and everything to keep Megan safe.<br><br>Although he was torn about whether or not she should find out, he was obligated to his job first, which meant he had to keep every bit of this operation to himself. She would be hurt and angry when she discovered what her brother was doing, and even more so when she realized Cameron had hidden the truth from her.<br><br>"You wearing pants?" she called out.<br><br>With a chuckle, Cameron shoved his wallet and phone into his back pocket. "Pants are a requirement?"<br><br>When he stepped into the hall, he stopped short. <i>Damn.</i> Megan had always been beautiful, and she always presented herself as classy and polished for work, but this morning she looked even more amazing than usual. There went that twist to his heart, the one that confirmed she was the most perfect woman for him. But he couldn't let her in, wouldn't subject her to his chaotic schedule, his stress from the job. Because if he was stressed, he knew she'd want to take some on herself to relieve him of any burden. He'd signed up for this career...Megan hadn't.<br><br>With her fitted red dress, a slim black belt accentuating her small waist and rounded hips and her dark hair down around her shoulders, she stole his breath&#x2014;something that rarely happened with any woman. Always Megan. Everything was always centered around Megan. She was special.<br><br>Which was why he shouldn't be looking at her as if she were a woman he'd met at a bar and wanted to bring home for the night. Not that he remembered what that was like. He hadn't been in a bar for personal recreation in so long, never mind bringing a woman back to his bed.<br><br>Megan deserved to be treasured, to be loved and come first in any man's life. Unfortunately he could only offer two of the three.<br><br>Cameron had always figured one of his brothers would scoop Megan up, and the thought had crippled him each time the image crept through his mind. Thankfully, both Eli and Drake had found the loves of their lives. Cameron was thrilled for them, but love wasn't for all the St. John boys. Cameron barely had time to catch any sleep, let alone devote to a relationship.<br><br>"Should I go back home and change?" she asked, raising a brow with a smirk on her face. "You're staring at me."<br><br>"No, no." He adjusted his jacket, hating the confining garment and feeling somewhat naked without his shoulder holster. "You're just looking exceptionally beautiful this morning."<br><br>"You mean my old paint-stained tank and tattered shorts I had on yesterday didn't make me look beautiful?" She fluttered her eyelids in a mocking manner he found ridiculously attractive.<br><br>He loved that no matter what life threw at her, she always found a way to be a bit snarky. Why hadn't some guy come along and swept her off her feet? Any man would be lucky to have her. She grilled an amazing steak, she was always there for him no matter what, she joked and she even drank beer with him.<br><br>If she married someone who loved her and treated her the way she deserved to be treated, Cameron might be able to get this notion that he was worthy of her out of his head. Because he sure as hell knew that was false. He wanted to see her happy with that family she'd always wanted. But she wasn't even dating anybody. Still, he couldn't tell her his feelings because there wasn't a happy ending if he chose that path. Telling Megan would only cause an awkward, uncomfortable wedge between them, and hurting her in any way would destroy him.</p><h2>Buttons for General Washington (1 Paperback/1 CD)</h2><p>Reconstructs a possible mission of the fourteen-year-old spy who carried messages to George Washington&#39;s camp in the buttons of his coat during the Revolutionary War.</p><p>Peter Roop, a Wisconsin State Teacher of the Year, has been bringing books and children together for more than 30 years. He has written extensively for Cricket and Cobblestone magazines. He currently writes and speaks full-time. Last year he visited 22 states and talked with more than 50,000 students!In Revolutionary times, spies sent secret messages in clever ways. In this true story, John Darragh, a teenaged spy from a Quaker family, carries a message to General Washington sewn inside his coat buttons. Narrator Jason Harris conveys how much is at stake (spies could be hung), creating a healthy dose of dramatic tension over John's loss of a button and his capture in the woods. Young historians will appreciate the accompanying book's simple but evocative watercolor illustrations and the production's background music, including the fifes and drums of a Revolutionary band. They'll also enjoy the story's plentiful dialogue as gruff soldiers, family members, and even General Washington himself make this story vivid for young history buffs.

What causes Jack's inexplicable waking dreams, if that is what they are, of robins' eggs and red feathers? It's almost as if someone is trying to tell him something. As that message becomes increasingly impossible to ignore, Jack is drawn back to the Territories and to his own hidden past, where he may find the soul-strength to enter a terrifying house at the end of a deserted track of forest, there to encounter the obscene and ferocious evils sheltered within it.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>In the seemingly paradisal Wisconsin town of French Landing, small distortions disturb the beauty: a talking crow, an old man obeying strange internal marching orders, a house that is both there and not quite there. And roaming the town is a terrible fiend nicknamed the Fisherman, who is abducting and murdering small children and eating their flesh. The sheriff desperately wants the help of a retired Los Angeles cop, who once collared another serial killer in a neighboring town.<p> Of course, this is no ordinary policeman, but Jack Sawyer, hero of Stephen King and Peter Straub's 1984 fantasy <i>The Talisman</i>. At the end of that book, the 13-year-old Jack had completed a grueling journey through an alternate realm called the Territories, found a mysterious talisman, killed a terrible enemy, and saved the life of his mother and her counterpart in the Territories. Now in his 30s, Jack remembers nothing of the Talisman, but he also hasn't entirely forgotten: </p><blockquote>When these faces rise or those voices mutter, he has until now told himself the old lie, that once there was a frightened boy who caught his mother's neurotic terror like a cold and made up a story, a grand fantasy with good old Mom-saving Jack Sawyer at its center. None of it was real, and it was forgotten by the time he was sixteen. By then he was calm. Just as he's calm now, running across his north field like a lunatic, leaving that dark track and those clouds of startled moths behind him, but doing it <i>calmly</i>.</blockquote> Jack is abruptly pulled into the case--and back into the Territories--by the Fisherman himself, who sends Jack a child's shoe, foot still attached. As Jack flips back and forth between French Landing and the Territories, aided by his 20-years-forgotten friend Speedy Parker and a host of other oddballs (including a blind disk jockey, the beautiful mother of one of the missing children, and a motorcycle gang calling itself the "Hegelian Scum"), he tracks both the Fisherman and a much bigger fish: the <i>abbalah</i>, the Crimson King who seeks to destroy the axle of worlds. <p> While <i>The Talisman</i> was a straightforward myth in 1980s packaging, <i>Black House</i> is richer and more complex, a fantasy wrapped in a horror story inside a mystery, sporting a clever tangle of references to Charles Dickens, Edgar Allan Poe, jazz, baseball, and King's own Dark Tower saga. <i>Talisman</i> fans will find the sure-footed Jack has worn well--as has the King/Straub writing style, which is much improved with the passage of two decades. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>Read by<br>15 cassettes/approx. 23 hours<br><br>The long-awaited sequel to the #1 bestseller <i>The Talisman</i>, to be published on September 15, 2001, the twentieth anniversary of the day <i>The Talisman </i>begins.<br><br>Twenty years ago, a boy named Jack Sawyer traveled to a parallel universe called the Territories to save his mother and her Territories "twinner" from a premature and agonizing death that would have brought cataclysm to the other world.

As that message becomes increasingly impossible to ignore, Jack is drawn back to the Territories and to his own hidden past, where he must find the soul-strength to enter a terrifying house at the end of a deserted track of forest, there to encounter the obscene and ferocious evils sheltered within it.</p><h2>Cervantes Street</h2><p>A <i>Latinidad List</i> Best Book of 2012<br><br>"<i>Cervantes Street</i> is exciting to read...Under Mr. Manrique's pen, the world of renaissance Spain and the Mediterranean is made vivid, its surface cracking with sudden violence and cruelty...This novel can be read as a generous salute across the centuries from one writer to another, as a sympathetic homage and recommendation...<i>Cervantes Street</i> brings to life the real world behind the fantastic exploits of the knight of La Mancha.

Throughout, Rowell includes examples of some of his most memorable images and relates fascinating anecdotes from his extraordinary photographic career.</p><p>What makes Rowell one of the world's top photojournalists and sets him apart from others in the field? Steve Werner, editor of <i>Outdoor Photographer</i>, says the magazine's most popular columnist pursues his art the way a mountain climber pursues a peak: "planning the logistics, overcoming the hardships and conquering the unknown." The text, based on Rowell's monthly column for the magazine, is accompanied by images "chosen to illustrate concepts" rather than exhibit his best work -- or so he claims. Don't believe him; the pictures will blow you out of the water as surely as a well-placed stick of dynamite."Few photographers capture the spirit and substance of high and wild places the way Galen Rowell does. He earned fame first as a climber, and now...he's possibly the world's best-known photojournalist." Outside Magazine<p>"The pictures, naturally, are remarkable."

The &#x201c;official&#x201d; version of Southern Reconstruction is that there was a reign of terror &#x2014; a systematic murder and intimidation by the &#x201c;white Southern ruling class&#x201d; who were determined to keep free people of colour in a virtual state of slavery. The real picture is a good deal more complicated. One can find plenty of material about conflict, intimidation, and killing in America during the period 1865-1877; but the Marxist class conflict formulary of history &#x2014; also known as Political Correctness&#x2014;takes for granted as fact what is clearly partisan propaganda of the time. They never ask the essential factual and moral question: Who initiated violence? John Chodes shows that the violence was begun by the Republicans through the establishment of the Union League. The Union League was a Northern organisation with the mission of maintaining the illegal and undemocratic control of the Republican Party in the South. Its mobs of Black &#x201c;militia&#x201d; led by Carpetbaggers engaged in intimidation, theft, harassment of the innocent, and murder. They deliberately provoked violent response. Their coercion was directed not only at whites, but towards the freedmen who refused to support the Republican regime. In other words, the Union League used the methods of the Ku Klux Klan before the Klan came into existence &#x2014; the Klan before the Klan! *** This title is enrolled in Kindle MatchBook.

Readers have long waited for her great grandson's warm and original rendition. They will be charmed by this edition of the classic tale, so wonderfully full of holiday spirit and Moses whimsy.</p></p><p>Whose tiny faces are peeking out from Santa's golden sleigh? Yikes! It's two of Santa's elves who are Christmas Eve stowaways. Beloved illustrator Jan Brett's version of <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> lets these two mischievous elves add their rambunctious spirit to this familiar 1823 rhyming story. Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England. While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and "away they all flew like the down on a thistle." Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons. They also give us a window on the mansion's inhabitants, including the children watching Santa's departure in awe. A sugarplum of a Christmas story, just right for a reading before "a long winter's nap." (Click to see a sample spread. Illustrations ï¿½1998 by Jan Brett. Published by G.P.

Readers of his new picture book are plunged into a realm of boundless imagination, a library where, after hours, the shelves come to life. Rows of books become rows of townhouses with cozily lit windows, and walkways through the stacks become canals full of bustling traffic. The story centers on Peter, whose home is a cookbook, and who is searching high and low for a missing tome entitled "How to Live Forever." He eventually finds it, of course, but after considering the advice of an odd creature called the Ancient Child, decides not to read it. The plot is almost beside the point?what fascinates is the quirky, highly precise world Thompson has created. His art is exquisitely detailed, full of wry embellishments that beg for extended viewing. Many of the visual puns are too sophisticated for younger readers but will delight adults. When Peter visits a Chinese garden, for instance, a turn of the page moves him from full-color environs to the cool blue-and-white of the classic Blue Willow china pattern. And a shelf devoted to food contains such sly titles as "The Guns of Macaroni," while the automotive section sports "Kind Hearts and Cadillacs." A multilayered book that excites interest on several levels, it issues an open invitation to a world readers will want to visit again and again.

Reader tells the extraordinary story of humankind&#39;s adaptation to the ferocious obstacles of forest, river and desert, and to the threat of debilitating parasites, bacteria and viruses unmatched elsewhere in the world. He also shows how the world&#39;s richest assortment of animals and plants has helped - or hindered - human progress in Africa.</p><p>"The ancestors of all humanity evolved in Africa," notes photojournalist John Reader at the beginning of this epic, panoramic overview of African history. From the formation of the continent to the present, Reader's informative narrative tells the story of the earliest dwellers and the natural obstacles of desert, jungle, and animals they faced, expertly entwining the development of humanity with the ecological and geographical evolution of the continent. He demonstrates how the physical makeup of Africa is like nowhere else on earth, both supporting and crippling human progress over time. Reader, who has lived and traveled in Africa for many years, explores the migration of humanity as early as 100,000 years ago out of Africa into Europe and South America, forming the earliest indigenous populations in these areas. At the same time he traces the effects of European settlers, slavery, and tribal warfare to the present day's independent states that have suffered through chronic disease, famine, and brutal conflict. Reader's passion for this continent is evident throughout the text, bringing to life his scrupulous research which explores in fascinating detail, the intricate and complex history of Africa. --<i>Jeremy Storey</i>Praise from England for Africa: A Biography of the Continent<br><br>"An absorbing safari into the soul of a continent."<br>--Time<br><br>"This is geography, history, anthropology, and ecology on a grand scale, and Reader has digested hundreds of books and gathered their contents into a rich, coherent, and highly readable account of Africa."<br>--Literary Review<br><br>"Remarkable . . . elegant . . .

People who have never before picked up a paintbrush or drawing pencil have discovered their artistic talents through our easy-to-follow instruction books. </p><p>A Little Bit of History </p><p>Walter Foster Publishing began as a one-man business in the 1920s, when Walter T. Foster, well known as an accomplished artist, caricaturist, art instructor, and art collector, began producing self-help art instruction books from his home in Laguna Beach, California. He originally wrote, illustrated, printed, bound, packaged, shipped, and distributed them himself. In the 1960s, as his product line grew, he moved the operation to a commercial facility, which allowed him to expand the company and achieve worldwide distribution. Although Walter passed away in 1981 at the age of 90, he is fondly remembered for his warmth, dedication, and his unique instruction books. </p><p>About Our Products </p><p>We at Walter Foster Publishing are dedicated to preserving the high standards and quality of excellence that Walter demanded of his products. We believe that artists are eager to learn, sharpen their skills and talents, and experience new artistic horizons. And we are aware that beginners may not always know where to start. Therefore, we offer everyone step-by-step, do-it-yourself art instruction books and kits that are accessible, entertaining, affordable, and informative. </p><p>Whether this is your first experience using a Walter Foster art book or the continuation of a long-term relationship with our products, we are sure that this title in our How to Draw and Paint series will delight you. Whatever your artistic ambitions, we wish you good luck and success, and we hope that you always have fun in the process!</p>The colorful and light-filled paintings of Robert Moore clearly communicate his deep respect and appreciation for nature. A reflective, soft-spoken individual, Robert discovered art early on as a way of expressing himself. A one-time aspiring lawyer, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree and teaching credentials from Eastern Oregon State College. His increasing desire to pursue fine art brought him a full scholarship to the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, where he majored in illustration and graduated with honors. <p>Such masters as Joaquin Sorrolla and Isaac Levitan have influenced Robert's approach to color harmonies and light. Much of his initial study included color theory classes that transformed his color blindness into a positive and distinctive element in his work and teaching. </p><p>Living along the Snake River in Idaho with his wife and five children, Robert is surrounded by the same scenic beauty that first captivated him as a child. Using vivid colors and high-key values, he prefers to work on location to best capture the immediate impression of each subject. Robert teaches workshops twice a year out of his studio/gallery in Declo, Idaho.</p></p><h2>Fields Of Gold</h2><p>This would be easier if I were writing about someone else.

The Order of Teutonic Knights ruled Prussia with an iron fist and plundered its neighbors. The Polish-Lithuanian Kingdom, a confederation wary of the Order, was reluctant to fight yet possessed the era's fiercest knights. Among these, Macko of Bogdaniec and his nephew, Zbyszko, are catalysts in the events leading to war. When the Order kidnaps Zbyszko's wife, their gallant search for her inspires all the Polish knights, and their victories set the stage for a broader conflagration. In his final work, Sienkiewicz ( Fire in the Steppe , LJ 6/1/92) tells a classic tale of knights-errant and chivalric love, of vast powers struggling in the early historic battles of his beloved Poland. His consistent themes of faith, honor, love, and duty mark his unstinting belief that greatness exists within each individual and that from great individuals arise great nations.

T., achieved a kind of Horatio Alger success in the scientific world of dinosaur studies. Forced to drop out of school at a young age by ill health, he was a cowboy who traveled from job to job by motorcycle until he met Barnum Brown, Curator of Vertebrae Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and a leader in the study of dinosaurs. Beginning in 1934, Bird spent many years as an employee of the museum and as Brown's right-hand man in the field. His chart of the Howe Quarry in Wyoming, a massive sauropod boneyard, is one of the most complex paleontological charts ever produced and a work of art in its own right. His crowning achievement was the discovery, collection, and interpretation of gigantic Cretaceous dinosaur trackways along the Paluxy River near Glen Rose and at Bandera, Texas. A trackway from Glen Rose is on exhibit at the American Museum and at the Texas Memorial Museum in Austin. His interpretation of these trackways demonstrated that a large carnosaur had pursued and attacked a sauropod, that sauropods migrated in herds, and that, contrary to then-current belief, sauropods were able to support their own weight out of deep water. These behavioral interpretations anticipated later dinosaur studies by at least two decades.<br><br> From his first meeting with Barnum Brown to his discoveries at Glen Rose and Bandera, this very human account tells the story of Bird's remarkable work on dinosaurs. In a vibrantly descriptive style, Bird recorded both the intensity and excitement of field work and the careful and painstaking detail of laboratory reconstruction. His memoir presents a vivid picture of camp life with Brown and the inner workings of the famous American Museum of Natural History, and it offers a new and humanizing account of Brown himself, one of the giants of his field.<br><br> Bird's memoir has been supplemented with a clear and concise introduction to the field of dinosaur study and with generous illustrations which delineate the various types of dinosaurs.</p><p>R. T. Bird, as he was called, made spectacular finds of dinosaur remains in the West during the 1930s. In later years he recalled the excitement of the finds; the dangers, frustrations, and fun of the camps; the brilliance of Brown, for many years curator of vertebrate paleontology of the American Museum of Natural History; and the drudgery of assembling the fragments to create some of the most spectacular displays in the world. Bird was a natural writ erdirect, understated, often witty. A concise introduction to vertebrate pale ontology, careful editing, and skillful captioning under the many photographs and drawings contribute to a lively vol ume for anyone interested in fossil- hunting in general and dinosaurs in par ticular. A good choiece for special collections and public and high school libraries. Walter C.

As they investigate, Marti learns that Barry's friends had a lot to hide, and she must uncover the whole truth before she becomes the next target. Alexandra O'Karma produces all the necessary emotions in this complex suspense--frustration, fear, and grief. Because the story was written over ten years ago, the pop musicians mentioned may not be among the favorites of today's teens. However, murder is timeless, and listeners can still relate to Marti's plight. K.M.D. ï¿½ AudioFile 2001, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright ï¿½ AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i>Grade 7-10 High-school senior Marti Lewis' world comes to a shattering halt when her childhood friend Barry Logan supposedly puts a revolver to his head, apparently another in a series of suicides at her suburban high school in Texas. Only Marti believes that Barry was murdered. Enlisting the help of young police officer Karen Prescott, Marti tracks down Barry's killer, all the while not realizing that she is setting herself up as his next target. The book goes in two directionsone dealing with the problem of teen suicide and the other with Marti's murder investigation. It goes astray on both counts. There is some factual and theoretical thought on the symptoms and causes of teen suicide smattered throughout the story, but not enough to be helpful or informative to readers curious about the subject. Nixon also masterfully denigrates any person who might be considered as a source of help or accurate information. The guidance counselor is condescending and incompetent; the suicide psychologist pompous and self-serving; the police, except Karen, bungling and insensitive; the clergyman preoccupied with his campaign against rock music lyrics; and the parents well-meaning but ineffective. And since she doesn't provide any alternatives, Nixon makes the message clear that for young people in need of answers about suicide, there is no suitable confidant. As for the mystery aspect, readers who even dabble in the genre will find many flaws. The identity of the murderer leaps out within the early chapters of the book, and the heinousness of the crimes he commits far outweigh his motive. The inefficiency of police forces has long been fair game in mystery stories, but this group's disregard for the most elementary forensic data will grate on readers. Readers will find both the mystery and the discussion of teen suicide very run of the mill.

Original.</p><p>Young Bostonian Patience Sinclair and her sisters, Hope and Charity, have vowed to have one grand adventure before marrying or settling into a career. For Patience, a season on the western rodeo circuit, researching historic and current female competitors for her doctoral dissertation, seems both an exciting escapade and a timely escape from spoiled society brat Tyler Stanfield, a rejected ex-lover who's been stalking her. Despite the instant, if prickly, attraction that Patience shares with handsome Dallas Kingman, a World Champion All-Around Cowboy, the pair's commitment to very different careers makes anything more than a summer fling seem impossible. But the two grow closer, even as mysterious malignant forces strive to tear the Circle C rodeo, owned by Dallas's uncle, apart. Passion predominates over intrigue in Martin's second Sinclair Sisters installment (after <i>Midnight Sun</i>), but the suspense serves to keep reader interest piqued as the protagonists agonize their way through apparently insoluble personal conflicts. A parallel suspense subplot involving historic rodeo murders lends the story some complexity, and several side romances and romantic rivalries add considerable charm to this satisfying tale. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Flashman Papers 1839-1842 Volume One Flashman, soldier, duellist, lover, imposter, coward, cad and hero, triumphs in this first instalment of The Flashman Papers. His adventures as the reluctant secret agent in Afghanistan and his entry into the exclusive company of Lord Cardigan&#39;s Hussars culminate in his foulest hour -- his part in the historic disaster of the Retreat from Kabul. This is the story of a blackguard who enjoyed villainy for its own sake. Shameless, exciting and funny, Flashman&#39;s deplorable odyssey is observed with the cynical eye of a scoundrel who was honest only in reporting what he saw. He makes all other black sheep look respectable grey.</p><p>The author of the famous Flashman Papers and the Private McAuslan stories, George MacDonald Fraser has worked on newspapers in Britain and Canada. In addition to his novels he has also written numerous screenplays, most notably The Three Musketeers, The Four Musketeers, and the James Bond film, Octopussy.<i>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t wait to die on the field of honour. Heroes draw no higher wages than the others.&#x2019;</i> &#x2013; soldier of fortune Paolo di Avitabile in <i>Flashman</i><br><br>Just before World War I, Mark Franklin, the hero of George MacDonald Fraser&#x2019;s Mr American, travels to London, where he spends a bibulous evening with an elderly military man by the name of Sir Harry Paget Flashman. &#x2018;He had looked Sir Harry up in Who&#x2019;s Who and read incredulously through the succinct list of campaigns and decorations &#x2013; that gnarled old man sleeping there had seen Custer ride into the broken bluffs above the Little Big Horn, and fought hand to hand with Afghan tribesmen more than seventy years ago; he had ridden into the guns at Balaclava and seen the ranks form for Pickett&#x2019;s charge at Gettysburg; he had known Wellington and Lincoln . . .&#x2019;<br><br>Who wouldn&#x2019;t be incredulous? Sir Harry&#x2019;s numerous honors include not only England&#x2019;s Victoria Cross, but also the French Legion of Honour and the American Congressional Medal of Honor. His Who&#x2019;s Who entry &#x2013; should you ever happen upon it &#x2013; requires four inches of small type just to list some of his nearly unbelievable exploits. During the course of a long life, Sir Harry Paget Flashman (1822&#x2013;1915) served as a political adviser to Chancellor Bismarck on the Schleswig-Holstein question, briefly functioned as chief of staff to the Rajah of Sarawak, rode with both John Brown and Jeb Stuart, and even assisted the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico as an aide-decamp. Over the years this far-ranging traveler also spent some time as a buffalo hunter, western scout, Australian prospector, &#x2018;reluctant deputy marshal to J. B. Hickok, Esq.,&#x2019; and native interpreter &#x2013; Sir Harry spoke nine languages fluently and could &#x2018;rub along&#x2019; in another dozen or so.<br><br>Naturally, Who&#x2019;s Who &#x2013; with British discretion &#x2013; barely hints that Harry Flashman frequently spied for Her Majesty&#x2019;s government and that he was mixed up in both the African slave trade and the Underground Railroad. Moreover, through a run of astonishing bad luck, the man seems to have landed smack in the middle of virtually every major battle or civil insurrection of the nineteenth century &#x2013; the Siege of Gandamack in Afghanistan, the Zulu attack at Rorke&#x2019;s Drift, the rising of the Mahdi at Khartoum, the Charge of the Light Brigade, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Peking Rebellion of 1900. During the American Civil War he even inexplicably managed to serve as a major in the Union forces and a colonel in the army of the Confederacy.<br><br>As it happens, when Mr Franklin met Sir Harry the then 92- year-old general had recently completed his personal memoirs, memoirs so disturbing that after his death they were quickly sealed and, it would appear, instantly forgotten. Indeed, the memory of Sir Harry himself gradually faded away, so that otherwise reliable histories of the Victorian era failed to assign him even a footnote. But, then, in 1965 during a sale of household furniture at Ashby in Leicestershire, the manuscript miraculously resurfaced. Ably edited by George MacDonald Fraser, the so-called Flashman Papers were eventually published in twelve volumes, each &#x2018;packet&#x2019; focusing on one or more episodes from their author&#x2019;s martial career. They begin with the teenaged Flashman&#x2019;s expulsion from Rugby School for drunkenness &#x2013; an incident mentioned in Thomas Hughes&#x2019;s almost libelous Tom Brown&#x2019;s School Days &#x2013; and follow him up to the unpleasantness, very late in his life, with Colonel Sebastian &#x2018;Tiger Jack&#x2019; Moran. That last name may be familiar, as Moran was once described by the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes as &#x2018;the second most dangerous man in London&#x2019; and &#x2018;the best heavy-game shot that our Eastern Empire has ever produced&#x2019;.<br><br>But, really, what impropriety in these reminiscences could have offended the sensibilities of the Flashman family? The author was the most upright of eminent Victorians, the recipient of the San Serafino Order of Purity and Truth, the honorary president of the Mission for the Reclamation of Reduced Females, and the former governor of his alma mater, that bastion of muscular Christianity, Rugby School. Perhaps Sir Harry&#x2019;s family, in particular his clerical son, the Reverend<br>Bishop Harry Albert Victor Flashman, simply felt it wiser for posterity to honor a public career already well documented in Dawns and Departures of a Soldier&#x2019;s Life and &#x2019;Twixt Cossack and Cannon. Yet time has not been kind to these stiffly official memoirs. They are as forgotten now as if they had never existed, while great scholars and common readers alike return regularly to the Flashman Papers for instruction and delight. And, it goes without saying, for the irresistible brazen effrontery of the man himself. For in these memoirs, Sir Harry Flashman, the supposed Victorian equivalent of a &#x2018;parfit gentil knyght,&#x2019; reveals himself to be &#x2013; in his own words &#x2013; &#x2018;a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward &#x2013; and, oh yes, a toady.&#x2019;<br><br>In fact, Flashman is one of the world&#x2019;s most entertaining and beguiling rogues. He pursues life&#x2019;s pleasures with Casanovian gusto, regularly employs the colorful language of the barracks, and knows that &#x2018;there isn&#x2019;t any folly a man won&#x2019;t contemplate if there&#x2019;s money or a woman at stake.&#x2019; With his gallant sidewhiskers, bold dark eyes with hooded lids, and strong, aquiline nose, this charming dastard &#x2013; fourteen stone of sheer manliness &#x2013; regularly seduces schoolgirls and queens, hides or runs away when fights break out, and manages, through deception and utter poltroonery, to survive when better men die. As he says (in Royal Flash): &#x2018;The ideal time to be a hero is when the battle is over and the other fellows are dead, God rest &#x2019;em, and you take the credit.&#x2019;<br><br>The three startling, even shocking adventures reprinted in this Everyman omnibus provide the ideal introduction to Sir Harry&#x2019;s rumbustious life. In Flashman the youthful anti-hero spends his last day at Rugby, enlists in the army, captures the heart (and body) of the fair-haired Elspeth, and reluctantly embarks on a mission to mountainous, war-torn Afghanistan. In Flash for Freedom! the luckless Flashy joins the crew of an African slave ship, unwillingly assists the Underground Railroad, and fortuitously meets a rising young American politician named Abraham Lincoln. (In later years, Lincoln was known to say: &#x2018;When all other trusts fail, turn to Flashman.&#x2019; I believe that the word &#x2018;all&#x2019; should be emphasized.) Finally, Flashman in the Great Game takes our man into the world of Kim, as he spies for the British, dallies with a luscious maharani, and desperately struggles to survive the blood-baths of the Sepoy Mutiny.<br><br>That he does so will hardly come as a surprise, nor that he emerges from his Indian nightmare not only alive but also elevated to a knighthood. Nevertheless, a few crudely unimaginative critics have suggested that nobody could actually have escaped from so many deadly ambushes and battles. Two or three have even gone so far as to speculate that George Mac-DonaldFraser is&nbsp; the&nbsp; author, not the editor, of the Flashman Papers, with the deeply cynical implication that Flashman himself is merely a character in a series of clever novels. Sigh. What can you expect these days from cloistered academics, none of whom is even half as alive as Flashman? Flashy may not be as admirable as, say, Don Quixote, Lord Greystoke or Sherlock Holmes, but he&#x2019;s certainly just as real.</p><h2>King Rufus: The Life and Mysterious Death of William II of England</h2><p><p>This is a major new biography of England's most irreligious king, famously killed accidentally whilst hunting in the new forest. The future William II was born in the late 1050s the third son of William the Conqueror.

When the Conqueror was dying in 1087, he designated William as heir to the English throne.

A person can occupy himself with these words while standing or sitting, while working or while walking about in his cell, on going to sleep, until sleep takes over, while he is indoors or while traveling on a journey, secretly occupying himself with them within his heart. Likewise, he can occupy himself with them while he remains kneeling on the ground or wherever he happens to be standing, even if is not in front of the cross, and then he will join the humility of his body with the stirrings of his prayer, for he will benefit from these words, as well as from those which he has laid down as his rule. He will also benefit from the place set aside, with the advantages if offers him as he confronts his changing state of mind and the times of peace and times of vexations which come upon him. Thus, by making use of these prayers which have been composed so that he may find comfort, his soul will receive sanctification by them and will be filled with the Grace of the Spirit.</p><p></p><h2>The Brass Band Robbery (Tales from Fern Hollow Series)</h2><p>Fun childrens book</p><p></p><h2>Healing Quest: In the Sacred Space of the Medicine Wheel</h2><p>The extraordinary description of Marie Herberts inner and outer journey toward renewed wholeness after the sudden, tragic death of her youngest daughter.

Swanson&#x2014;the Edgarï¿½ Award-winning, <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author of <em>Manhunt</em><em>&#x2014;brings to life two epic events of the Civil War era: </em>the thrilling chase to apprehend Confederate president Jefferson Davis in the wake of the Lincoln assassination and the momentous&nbsp;&nbsp;20&nbsp;-day funeral that took Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s body home to Springfield. A true tale full of fascinating twists and turns, and lavishly illustrated with dozens of rare historical images&#x2014;some never before seen&#x2014;<em>Bloody Crimes </em>is a fascinating companion to Swanson&#x2019;s <em>Manhunt </em>and&nbsp;&nbsp;a riveting true-crime thriller that will electrify civil war buffs, general&nbsp;readers, and everyone in between.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2010</strong>: It's April 1865 and General Lee's troops have officially surrendered. Abraham Lincoln, looking forward to rebuilding the nation, celebrates with an evening&#x2014;his last alive&#x2014;at the theater. On the other side of the Mason-Dixon Line Jefferson Davis plans to move the Confederate government to North Carolina, away from Union troops that have captured Richmond. Under much different circumstances, both men embark on a dramatic final journey depicted by James. L. Swanson in <em>Bloody Crimes</em>, a gripping account of the weeks following Lincoln&#x2019;s death and the end of the Civil War. While arguments erupted about where and how Lincoln&#x2019;s burial should take place, Jefferson Davis&#x2014;refusing to let the South succumb&#x2014;attempted to rally his people despite being hunted by Northern troops who suspected his involvement in Lincoln&#x2019;s assassination. Using relics and key documents of the day, Swanson juxtaposes the travels of Davis and Lincoln, weaving a fast-paced narrative that lures readers in from the get-go. We know that eventually Lincoln makes it to his final resting place and Davis is captured, but along the way it&#x2019;s hard not to wonder if these two heroic leaders were more similar than perhaps anyone would have guessed. Whether read as a companion to <em>Manhunt</em>&#x2014;Swanson&#x2019;s account of the 12-day search for John Wilkes Booth&#x2014;or on its own, <em>Bloody Crimes</em> is the next great Civil War-era read worthy of the recognition that Lincoln once said we should all strive for. --<em>Jessica Schein</em> <p></p> <br> <strong> Amazon Exclusive: James L. Swanson on Writing <em>Bloody Crimes</em></strong> <br> <br> I wrote <em>Bloody Crimes</em> as a way of answering a question many <em>Manhunt</em> readers asked: &#x201c;What happened next?&#x201d; In <em>Manhunt</em> I told just one of the three incredible stories that unfolded at the climax of the Civil War. I could only hint at the strange and amazing things that happened to Lincoln&#x2019;s body after he died, and I could do no more than allude to Jefferson Davis&#x2019;s dramatic flight from Richmond and his six week odyssey to save the Confederacy. So it would be correct to say that <em>Bloody Crimes</em> is a sequel to <em>Manhunt</em>. <p></p> Since I was a child, I&#x2019;ve been fascinated by the Lincoln funeral train, and I debated whether to write a book about that story alone. It is hard for a modern reader to comprehend how much Lincoln&#x2019;s death, the White House funeral, the Pennsylvania Avenue procession, and the president&#x2019;s sojourn home to Illinois influenced America. Imagine the death of President Kennedy and intensify by several degrees the emotions it released. As I researched the Lincoln funeral pageant, I began thinking about another president on his great journey. As I studied Davis, I realized that he is one of the &#x201c;Lost Men&#x201d; of American history. Today we know so little about him. To my great surprise, he and Lincoln had much in common. Some of their shared experiences were stunning, even profound. And in April 1865, both presidents left their White Houses, took to the field, and sought to rally their armies at the climax of the war. <p></p> Combining the final journeys of Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis into one book presented several challenges. I needed to return to the assassination, but I did not want to repeat material from <em>Manhunt</em>. I solved that problem by, like a film director, shifting the camera and pointing it in a different direction. In <em>Manhunt</em>, my camera captured every moment of action inside Ford&#x2019;s Theatre. In <em>Bloody Crimes</em>, that camera never sets foot inside Ford&#x2019;s, but instead takes position inside the Petersen House, capturing the assassination through fresh eyes, those of the boarders who lived there and the visitors who descended upon it. In <em>Manhunt</em>, once Lincoln was dead, he ceased to be a principal character in the book. In <em>Bloody Crimes</em>, though Lincoln is dead, he remains a vital character until the end. One of the pleasures of writing the book was meeting the splendid cast of characters who played significant roles in the death pageant, including the larger-than-life Commissioner of Public Buildings in Washington, D.C., Benjamin Brown French, who kept an amazing diary. <p></p> Another great pleasure was experiencing the final journey of Jefferson Davis through the firsthand accounts of his inner circle, cabinet members, young female loyalists, and his family, especially Davis&#x2019;s wife Varina. The love letters they exchanged during his darkest days go unread today, but they are as moving as the correspondence of John and Abigail Adams. <p></p> I cannot write a book without holding in my hand the original sources&#x2014;Civil War newspapers, documents, photos, and artifacts&#x2014;and I must visit the sites where history happened. Through these objects and places, I travel back in time and, I hope, take my readers with me. Many of the places I visited while writing <em>Bloody Crimes</em> still haunt me: The Confederate White House, where toys still lie upon the floor, as if the Davis children will return momentarily to continue their play; the East Room of Lincoln&#x2019;s White House, site of his majestic funeral; the cemetery vault in Georgetown, where Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s dead son Willie waited for his father to claim him and bring him home to Illinois; and the graves of Jefferson Davis and his family at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. Indeed, shortly before the publication of <em>Bloody Crimes</em>, I visited the grave of Jefferson Davis. A powerful storm had twisted and torn from the ground a mighty oak tree that had, for the past century, offered shade to Davis&#x2019;s grave and bronze statue. Had the massive tree fallen in a slightly different direction, it would have smashed the gravestone and toppled Jefferson Davis from his pedestal. <p></p> The final journeys of Lincoln and Davis, each a martyr to his cause, tell the stories of two men, two peoples, and two nations during the most thrilling days in American history. Their dual stories form an American epic, a kind of American <em>Iliad</em>, that made our history, and that continues to influence it to this day.<br><p>On the morning of April 2, 1865, Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy, received a telegram from General Robert E. Lee. There is no more time&#x2014;the Yankees are coming, it warned. Shortly before midnight, Davis boarded a train from Richmond and fled the capital, setting off an intense and thrilling chase in which Union cavalry hunted the Confederate president. </p><p>Two weeks later, President Lincoln was assassinated, and the nation was convinced that Davis was involved in the conspiracy that led to the crime. Lincoln's murder, autopsy, and White House funeral transfixed the nation. His final journey began when soldiers placed his corpse aboard a special train that would carry him home on the 1,600-mile trip to Springfield. Along the way, more than a million Americans looked upon their martyr's face, and several million watched the funeral train roll by. It was the largest and most magnificent funeral pageant in American history.</p><p>To the Union, Davis was no longer merely a traitor.

A New Englander by birth, he headed north to Alaska after the stock-market crash. Jack's story is narrated by his daughter Sunny, who runs the Alaska-Yukon Gamelands brothel and who is haunted by nightmares of her domineering fa ther and his mysterious death. Hawkes's new novel is less compelling as a study of a father-daughter relation ship than as a collection of Alaskan tall tales, some of them very good indeed. A far livelier and more amiable work than his mock-pornographic Virginie ( LJ 5/15/82), Adventures may broaden Hawkes's readership considerably. In Innocence in Extremis , Jack is 12 when his philandering father returns to France with his menage to visit his own father, a ``provincial aristocrat'' and an even greater philanderer. This novella describes the sexual crosscurrents at : the Old Gentleman's chateau, Jack's introduction to the world of passion, and his puritanical mother's ambivalent reaction. This is an overly schematic footnote to Jack's Alaskan adventures, and most likely to appeal to those famil iar with Hawkes's earlier, somewhat cold-blooded fiction.

Our current ideas of this country at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula have been hijacked by images of the terrorist strongholds, drone attacks, and diplomatic tensions. But, as Mackintosh-Smith reminds us in this newly updated book, there is another Arabia. Yemen may be a part of Arabia, but it is like no place on earth.</p><p>Englishman Tim Mackintosh-Smith was studying Arabic at Oxford when he visited Yemen, a forgotten country at the heel of the Arabian peninsula, and became obsessed with the place and its language. He's lived there since 1982, and this book--marketed as travel writing but more a blend of personal memoir and national history--is the result. There are certainly travel episodes, such as a trip to the remote island of Susqatra where the Gulf of Aden meets the Indian Ocean. Yet <i>Yemen</i> is more the product of a man gone native than a visitor with an itinerary. Indeed, Mackintosh-Smith offers a forthright defense of the country's lotus-like drug culture, which centers on <i>qat</i>, a leaf that produces a narcotic effect when chewed. "We <i>qat</i> chewers, if we are to believe everything that is said about us, are at best profligates, at worst irretrievable sinners," he writes. Although international health officials have warned against the drug, Mackintosh-Smith assures us this is all "quasi-scientific poppycock." The leaf, he says, helps its users to "think, work, and study." Yemen is surely an exotic land, and one of its charms--fully revealed in Mackintosh-Smith's digressive prose--is the way it has remained quaintly Arabic and seemingly immune to the modern forces transforming its neighbors. Well-received upon its initial publication in the United Kingdom, <i>Yemen</i> may come to be recognized as a small classic. <i>--John J. Miller</i>Tim Mackintosh-Smith has lived in Yemen since 1982, earning the official title of Shaykh of Nazarenes. This, his first book, won the Thomas Cook Travel Book Award.</p><h2>Penguin Modern Classics Lives of Girls and Women</h2><p><i>Lives of Girls and Women</i> is the intensely readable, touching, and very funny story of Del Jordan, a young woman who journeys from the carelessness of childhood through an uneasy adolescence in search of love and sexual experience. <p>As Del dreams of becoming famous, suffers embarrassment about her mother, endures the humiliation of her body's insistent desires, and tries desperately to fall in love, she grapples with the crises that mark the passage to womanhood.</p></p><p>7 1.5-hour cassettesThe only novel from Alice Munro-award-winning author of The Love of a Good Woman--is an insightful, honest book, "autobiographical in form but not in fact," that chronicles a young girl's growing up in rural Ontario in the 1940's. <br>Del Jordan lives out at the end of the Flats Road on her father's fox farm, where her most frequent companions are an eccentric bachelor family friend and her rough younger brother. When she begins spending more time in town, she is surrounded by women-her mother, an agnostic, opinionted woman who sells encyclopedias to local farmers; her mother's boarder, the lusty Fern Dogherty; and her best friend, Naomi, with whom she shares the frustrations and unbridled glee of adolescence. <br>Through these unwitting mentors and in her own encounters with sex, birth, and death, Del explores the dark and bright sides of womanhood. All along she remains a wise, witty observer and recorder of truths in small-town life. The result is a powerful, moving, and humorous demonstration of Alice Munro's unparalleled awareness of the lives of girls and women.</p><h2>Entropy in Bloom: Stories</h2><p><b>Book Riot Contemporary Horror Top 50 *&nbsp;B</b><b>arnes &amp; Noble Best of Horror 2017 *&nbsp;</b><b>MCL Best of 2017 *&nbsp;</b><b>Undead Airlock Best of 2017 *&nbsp;</b><b>Dead End Follies Top 10</b> <br> <br> <b>Named one of the most anticipated books of 2017 by <i>LitReactor</i> and <i>Big Other</i> and one of the Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Books Everyone Will Be Talking About by <i>Kirkus/Black Gate</i>.</b><br><br><b>Includes "When Susurrus Stirs," the basis for the award-winning motion picture of the same name.</b><br><br>"Johnson is a master of mood, seamlessly combining the literary with the grotesque.

J. Hillis Miller, one of America&#x2019;s leading teacher-critics, sets the record straight by looking into a series of fictions that allow him to show that ethics has always been at the heart of deconstructive literary criticism. Miller proves his point not by assertion but by doing&#x2015;deconstruction is here in the hands of a master teacher.</p><p>Miller&#x2019;s controlling image is Ovid&#x2019;s Pygmalion, who made a statue that came alive and whose descendants (the incestuous Myrrha, the bloodied Adonis) then had to bear the effects of what he did. All storytellers can be seen as Pygmalions, creating characters (personification) who must then act, choose, and evaluate (what Miller calls the &#x201c;ethics of narration&#x201d;). If storytellers must be held accountable for what they create, then so must critics or teachers who have their own stories to tell when they write or discuss stories. If the choices are heavy, they are also, Miller wryly points out, happily unpredictable.</p><p>The teacher&#x2019;s first &#x201c;ethical act&#x201d; is the choice of what to teach, and Miller chooses his texts boldly. As an active reader, the kind demanded by deconstruction, Miller refashions each story, another ethical act, an intervention that may have social, political, and historical consequences. He then looks beyond text and critical theory to ask whether writing literature, reading it, teaching it, or writing about it makes anything happen in the real world of material history.</p></p><p>J. Hillis Miller is Distinguished Research Professor of Comparative Literature and English at the University of California, Irvine. He is the author of many books and articles on literature and literary theory, most recently &#34;For Derrida&#34;.Miller illuminates "what is at stake when someone becomes infatuated with a statue or a painting or . . . when someone reads or hears a story and thinks of its characters as 'real people.' " The question is one of personification (prosopopoeia), and Miller chooses Ovid's Pygmalion story as the locus classicus for "the ascription to entities that are not really alive first of a name , then of a face, and finally . . . of a voice." He then examines this trope and its implications in James's What Maisie Knew and "The Last of the Valerii," Kleist's "Der Findling," Melville's "Bartleby the Scrivener," and Blanchot's L'Asset du mort . These readings also fulfill his promise, made in The Ethics of Reading (1987), to examine the relation between ethics and narrative. If "deconstruction" is Miller's method, his perspectives and learning are broad, his insight valuable; this elegant book is for specialists as well as those concerned with current literary criticism.<br><i>- Richard Kuczkowski, Dominican Coll., Blauvelt, N.Y.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Dragon at Worlds&#39; End (Bazil Broketail)</h2><p>Bazil and his dragoneer, Relkin, find themselves lost in the trackless jungle of the Ardu, and Relkin is kidnapped while protecting the Ardu from their Elven-mage slavers, leaving Bazil alone to rescue everyone.

Twenty-five years later, these men will be plunged into a horrifying struggle with a creature from another world. Their only chance of survival is locked in their past - and in the Dreamcatcher.</p><p>Stephen King fans, rejoice! The bodysnatching-aliens tale <i>Dreamcatcher</i> is his first book in years that slakes our hunger for horror the way he used to. A throwback to <i>It</i>, <i>The Stand</i>, and <i>The Tommyknockers</i>, <i>Dreamcatcher</i> is also an interesting new wrinkle in his fiction.<p> Four boyhood pals in Derry, Maine, get together for a pilgrimage to their favorite deep-woods cabin, Hole in the Wall. The four have been telepathically linked since childhood, thanks to a searing experience involving a Down syndrome neighbor--a human dreamcatcher. They've all got midlife crises: clownish Beav has love problems; the intellectual shrink, Henry, is slowly succumbing to the siren song of suicide; Pete is losing a war with beer; Jonesy has had weird premonitions ever since he got hit by a car.</p><p> Then comes worse trouble: an old man named McCarthy (a nod to the star of the 1956 film <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i>) turns up at Hole in the Wall. His body is erupting with space aliens resembling furry moray eels: their mouths open to reveal nests of hatpin-like teeth. Poor Pete tries to remove one that just bit his ankle: "Blood flew in splattery fans as Pete tried to shake it off, stippling the snow and the sawdusty tarp and the dead woman's parka. Droplets flew into the fire and hissed like fat in a hot skillet."</p><p> For all its nicely described mayhem, <i>Dreamcatcher</i> is mostly a psychological drama. Typically, body snatchers turn humans into zombies, but these aliens must share their host's mind, fighting for control. Jonesy is especially vulnerable to invasion, thanks to his hospital bed near-death transformation, but he's also great at messing with the alien's head. While his invading alien, Mr. Gray, is distracted by puppeteering Jonesy's body as he's driving an Arctic Cat through a Maine snowstorm, Jonesy constructs a mental warehouse along the lines of <i>The Memory Palace of Matteo Ricci</i>. Jonesy physically feels as if he's inside a warehouse, locked behind a door with the alien rattling the doorknob and trying to trick him into letting him in. It's creepy from the alien's view, too. As he infiltrates Jonesy, experiencing sugar buzz, endorphins, and emotions for the first time, Jonesy's influence is seeping into the alien: "A terrible thought occurred to Mr. Gray: what if it was <i>his</i> concepts that had no meaning?"</p><p> King renders the mental fight marvelously, and telepathy is a handy way to make cutting back and forth between the campers' various alien battlefronts crisp and cinematic. The physical naturalism of the Maine setting is matched by the psychological realism of the interior struggle. Deftly, King incorporates the real-life mental horrors of his own near-fatal accident and dramatizes the way drugs tug at your consciousness. Like the Tommyknockers, the aliens are partly symbols of King's (vanquished) cocaine and alcohol addiction. Mainly, though, they're just plain scary. <i>Dreamcatcher</i> is a comeback and an infusion of rich new blood into King's body of work. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><b>Stephen King</b> is the author of more than thirty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.
